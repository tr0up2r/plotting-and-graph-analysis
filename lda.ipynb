I would heavily encourage you to look into this at your college, as most have online options if Covid is still limiting in person activities where you live.

But this simply isnâ€™t true. People are not divided into haves and have nots and to think so is a fallacy. This does not invalidate your experiences, itâ€™s just to suggest that your upbringing isnâ€™t black or white, it was gray.

If you were on the other side, and were raised rich and spoiled youâ€™d be stressed or depressed about different things. Iâ€™m not trying to be a dick, Iâ€™m trying to speak from a place of compassion. When depressed or struggling with any mental illness, it can be easy to fixate on certain ideas or how things could be different, such as someone with anxiety fixating on past embarrassing events.   However, given the lasting impact of your high school experiences, Iâ€™d suggest therapy, it sounds like you have a lot to work through, and although it may not sound or seem traumatic to you, there are events called â€œlittle tâ€™sâ€\\x9d which are highly distressing events that affect people on a personal level but donâ€™t qualify as a big t or trauma as most consider it.

I am really sorry you are feeling the way you do. I can relate to a lot of you have gone through. It's tough, very tough. Emotional pain is the worst, it takes everything out of you.  It's great to know you have a loving family and a few good friends, that's such a positive element in your life. It's normal to feel alone even among the ones you love, because of the issues you are dealing with. If you are anything like me, you have trouble telling them how you really feel most of the time and the need to talk and release all the darkness is overwhelming.   It's also good to know you are getting help with medication and therapy. Those will help you deal with your mental issues, but very slowly and gradually. It's a start though.   I would say (knowing you will have bad days when you can't even move or make an effort because it just feels that depleted) try to keep yourself busy (body and mind), plan your days so you are not idle and vulnerable to overthinking and getting trapped by your brain.  Try switching your focus to things other than the loop of dark thoughts that haunt us: exercise (even if just a walk in garden or a park), play games with friends, play fast-paced/engaging videogames or read books that take you somewhere else, write/journal about how you feel, about your dreams and goals. Don't be afraid to admit you are not having a good day and allow your family and friends to be there for you.   Regarding relationships, again I felt the same way as you when I was your age. I didn't think anybody would ever be interested in me in that way. My first meaningful relationship only happened when I was about 25 and I only found my partner of 10 years now when I was 36. We are very happy together. I do feel I am a burden to him sometimes, because dealing with my worst days is a strain on both of us, but we deal with it the best we can. I was also honest with him about my issues from the start.   Everybody has issues of some kind. Don't feel like you are unlovable, just because of your troubles. Love will happen for you too.

I've gone through truly difficult times in the past but now I look at them as such, in the past and am happy with my life as it is. Don't give up. Life is such a precious thing to waste. Also, there are people who have gone through being suicidal so you're situation is not hopeless despite the way it may seem because others have gone through similar situations and have pulled through and are glad with their lives. Even if you think nobody in the world cares about you and your suicide would be not be cared about then you are wrong, because at the very least I care. I don't know you but what I do know is that taking your own life is not worth it. You sound like you're at a breaking point based on the way you wrote, so I would recommend getting help immediately. It's an obvious fact that this world is not a paradise or a utopia. This world truly has serious issues, unfair issues. However, this world is not rotten whole.

Itâ€™s hard when you do or may struggle with feelings of self-confidence or self-worth. I empathize completely. Your metaphor was astute and relatable.  What I will say is that I stole my first kiss in a red 2-door Accord, it was horrible and awkward and we clanked teeth, but I donâ€™t think I would ever give that memory up. Itâ€™s really easy, especially in the age of social media, to feel like *everyone* is looking for the same thingâ€¦ slip up, slip out of the â€œidealized versionâ€\\x9d of a partner â€“ youâ€™re tossed out like yesterdayâ€™s rubbish. Itâ€™s hard to hang on to optimism (even the cautious kind) when there is so much of it in your face, at every turn.  Again, I can empathize with you about this stuff. It seems like a fairly common occurrence with people who would be considered â€œempathsâ€\\x9d. I find a lot of damaged people gravitate towards me because I so easily empathize with, and strive to take care of, them, even forsaking my own well-being. Itâ€™s a trait I have to work hard to keep in line. You seem a bit like this as well, itâ€™s probably very difficult for you to turn someone away if theyâ€™re hurting. On the other end, people who have low self-worth do seem to send out a signal for people who are controlling and abusive. Itâ€™s like they can sense it on you, and they swoop in to exploit it. I am so sorry that you have faced such a myriad of issues and abuses within your partnerships past. Itâ€™s very difficult to navigate those feelings of â€œmock gratefulnessâ€\\x9d for someone saying they care about youâ€¦ even if that care is twisted and hurtful. I find I am quick to forgive because I feel like, geez, if I donâ€™t forgive this thing (this sometime huge hurtful thing) theyâ€™ll leave, because they hardly have a reason to be here at all. Itâ€™s painful, the inner narrative can be so loud, and Iâ€™m just so sorry youâ€™ve faced this so often.  I have a very complicated relationship with this whole â€œself-loveâ€\\x9d movement and those â€œno one will love you unless you love yourselfâ€\\x9d sentiments. It all seems like bullshit, to be frank. Bullshit that drives people further away from connection and deeper into isolation, robbing them of lifeâ€™s many joys for fear that they will be rejected outright for not being this beacon of health, love, and inner wellness.  That all being said, and to quote Morrissey â€œI might walk home alone, but my faith in love is still devout!â€\\x9d I have the utmost faith that all of this is just a primer for folks like you and I, and that a wealth of love is being stored up for us, and that it will come when we need it most, and it will be so sweet, and so worth the wait.

It feels cheesy when you start, but it will save you from starting when you're my age and have already lived half your life.   If you don't have many resources available and are still in school (HS or college) there will be resources available through school. If you're in the US, check out your local NAMI or what ever is the mental health equivalent in your country. Peer groups and other services through them might be another option.

In my case I assume it was more the case of being over their head with work to give me and my siblings a better life, than an ego trip.  But I have resentments for their behaviour, still. And I am 44 years old.  In retrospective, there so many warning signs, so many red flags that they didn't see, or didn't want to see. There was always the component of blaming, when I fucked up my father said it's my mother's fault, but she also had a little shop, because they wanted a better life.  They somehow couldn't figure out that someone has to be there for the kids.  If I was in your shoes with the perspective I have now, I would say tell what you just wrote down to your parents. Make them understand that you are afraid, that you don't think that you are strong enough to meet your, or even lifes expectations.  If they really care they will understand and try to figure out a way with you. If they don't take you seriously, ask them about that also. Why don't they value your opinion? It's your life that is on the line.  I understand how difficult it can be to try to talk to parents who don't seem to get it, but for your own sake, you should try. At least that way you know that you have done everything in your power to make them understand your feelings.  It's up to them at this point to take you serious or not.

When we feel as if we are out of the depths it doesn't change the fact that when we were at our low points, chances are we missed out on life events, avoided responsibilities, damaged ourselves physically but also damaged our relationships as well. The list goes on and on of casualties of our depression.  The feeling you get could be subconscious or active mind realizing when you come out to see the day of light how much work you have ahead of you to fix your situation. This is oftentimes why people who go on anti-depressants kill themselves, they are in their depths and come out of them unnaturally perhaps or at an odd time and have the energy they didn't expect to have and now they are faced with reality and see no other choice but to end it all.

       " \"> Are you able to pin point when in your life you were mostly happy and when did it slowly or suddenly change into a depression?   I think it is really hard to define a specific moment in my life where the depression started because for me it was a really slow process. I've got social anxiety for like ten years now, tho it was only diagnosed half a year ago because I never went to get help. But I'd say its been like two or three years now that I am really depressed - afaik it is also common for people with anxiety to become depressed if not treated with therapy.  > Was it a single or multiple things that contributed you becoming depressed?   definitely multiple things. A really big factor for me was being addicted to weed in my teen years. From like 16 till 19 years old I smoked every day. Then also my sister is bipolar and there was always some drama from her. And I lived with her for about a year before I moved back to my mom where she had an abusive bf who wanted to hit her one day where I just stood before her to protect her and he pushed me over and destroyed some furniture. I think I was 17 when that happened. There are also some more factors like having my parents divorce when I was 9 and having no friends in the new school for the next few years (I was the weird kid) nobody in my class liked me and they often ignored me and made fun of me.  &#x200B;  > Do you think there is something missing from your life and by getting that thing it could improve your situation greatly?   Yes. Having a Job I actually like and can do with severe social anxiety.   Maybe having an SO would help as I feel really lonely and sometimes you just cant tell everything you parents/friends etc. But I am unsure if I could maintain a stable and helathy relationship in my current situation.\",\n",
       " 'Your questions are kinda difficult, but I\\'m gonna try and answer the best I can, according to my personal experience. Keep in mind, my answers  do not apply to all depressed people and others could give you vastly different perspectives. That said:  As to a \"turning point\" in my life, that was when I was about 13 years old, though it took me more than a year to fully realize what\\'s going on. It was all \"jokes\" at first and sooner than I knew I was spending less than two hours a day for actual activities other than sleep and school, not eating, not meeting my friends, etc.   I don\\'t know what made me like this. I didn\\'t have the worst childhood. My parents weren\\'t the best, but they could\\'ve done way worse and many people\\'s parents actually do. I\\'m not a part of any minority so I\\'m not oppressed and haven\\'t had to deal with any discrimination first hand, my family is not rich, not by a large margin, but we weren\\'t living in poverty. There was more or less nothing particularly wrong with my life, to suggest I\\'d attempt suicide at some point. I just got depression and that\\'s it.  Right now, nothing is missing from my life. Maybe a few years ago, but currently, I\\'m renting a nice (albeit tiny) place with my girlfriend, got a job I love, even though this year employment has been very inconsistent, but even though we\\'re struggling from time to time, things are looking up.   Still, I think of suicide multiple times a day. There\\'s nothing in my life that can be improved, that I\\'m not actively working on. But, for me at least, depression never goes away. I think even if I achieve all of my ultimate goals in life, I\\'d still think about killing myself daily. I could get meds, but I don\\'t want them. Personally, just learned (and still learn) to live with it. Ain\\'t easy, but the other option ain\\'t much good either.',\n",

       " 'Thatâ€™s a rough go man. Parents divorcing isnâ€™t easy. Especially if youâ€™re put in a situation where youâ€™re feeling like you have to choose a parent. Is there a way to split your time between parents? Like is there a parenting plan they could come up with a way you could stay at one place during the week and maybe the weekends with the other? Your dad managing the team and the signs of trouble starting around the same time doesnâ€™t mean that you caused it! That means there were underlying problems that got brought to the surface. Happy marriages donâ€™t just end in divorce because someone becomes busy for a valid reason. If he was going out and being a dickhead thatâ€™s one thing. But he was doing something that she should have been grateful for! So I donâ€™t think that you have ANYTHING to do with that whatsoever. I know itâ€™s hard to think that way.  You definitely need to reach out to someone regarding the thoughts youâ€™re having. Those thoughts are overwhelming and scary, and sometimes it helps just being able to have someone to help pinpoint where theyâ€™re coming from to better help stopping them. Idk if the person at your school would be able to prescribe you medication, Iâ€™m not saying that thatâ€™s what you need, but if you need the help of an antidepressant, thatâ€™s okay. Thereâ€™s no shame in that. If you have a primary care doctor, they can refer you to someone to speak to I think as well. Thatâ€™s how I started meeting with my therapist.

Consciousness, and the experience of being alive-being able to experience and understand various stimuli through the senses that we have developed through millions of years of evolution, and witnessing the universe in the state it is and at time we are here is a gift that needs to be explored. It's awe-inspiring, magical and mystical.  There is no disagreeing to the fact that there is a lot of suffering and there are lots of people who have gone through the cycle of horrendous fate that you spoke of - endlessly and hopelessly. But this is not a direct result of of the universe existing (although everything can be traced back to the rules that fundamentally govern the working of the universe). It is a system of disparity that we have chosen to create, sustain and actively ignore. There might not be things that can be done at times, since the the society we have created has gone through many tests and has somehow stumbled to this point in time where you can type this on a forum and receive banter from a guy you helped a few weeks ago(bonus!).       Wishing to be 'nothing' is alright, I too think about 'how' it is indeed possible through quantum physical laws for the universe to have sprung up from nothingness. But there's no answer to the 'why?'. From lawlessness to beauty and elegance of quantum mechanics - it seems there is a creator (several phenomenon in physics point towards this, add to it the fact that 96% Universe is Dark matter & Energy so we'll never know enough about our own universe let alone anything outside this system). There might even be a purpose to it, any future civilization might never know. So being nothing would've been great. No existence, no experiences, no problems.        But the fact remains that there is consciousness waiting to be explored, there is the naked, vast universe waiting to be 'conquered' (as humans like to put it), and there is a lot of beauty in life especially if you were born in a priveliged society in a developed country.
