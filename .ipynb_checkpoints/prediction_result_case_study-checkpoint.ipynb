A few years ago, I decided that I had to do something about it and I found an intensive outpatient (so you go everyday for the majority of the day, like school - we called it brain school) program that specialized in DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) and it changed my life. Before, I'd lose my shit if one of my kids (or spouse) used the wrong bowl for a specific purpose, but DBT (along with a mild tranquilizer at first) taught me to put some space between me and the meltdown, which then allowed me to question its truth/importance/etc.   If your mom is receptive to IOP DBT, I can't recommend it enough.

      "Pretty much every day for about 50 years now I have said the same thing as you're saying, \"I want to die; I can't do this life of depression; I can't commit suicide; I'm exhausted.\" I've probably lost a total of about a decade in serious, unmanaged, un-moveable depression; the rest has just been regular depression (I have, among other mental health issues, double dysthymia).  Thing is, for the past year maybe, I've decided I can do it. It's all there is, managing this depression. 95% of the time I do get out of bed, I do get showered and dressed, I do manage to accomplish a few simple things, like wash the dishes and clean a bathroom and maybe, on a good day, take a short walk. This doesn't sound like much but for me it's huge, tremendous. Instead of just being in bed all day, or wanting to be, I am functioning for several hours a day most the time. Low-level functioning to be sure, but functioning.  Do I still hope to die soon? Why yes, yes I do. (In fact, at my annual exam a few weeks back, they found a health issue and prescribed medication. I'm not taking it; I have no desire to extend my days). I watch hours of meaningless TV and sometimes just sit blankly. I don't feel joy or sorrow. But I do it. This is what my life is. All those years would have been easier if I had just accepted that no amount of drugs, therapy, exercise, diet, or meditation would \"cure\" me: all I could possibly hope for was managing my disorder.  I hope you can find a way to manage now, instead of waiting until you're rounding the final bend. Who knows, maybe you can do a lot better than I have, but as poorly as I do, it's better than the total Abyss or the Swamp. I wish you well.\n",

I sincerely hope you find peace without death friend.

      "My trich was at its worst during school/university as well. I was much less active, always sitting around at a computer or in a textbook. Constant stress of assignments, deadlines, financial stress.   I think that was the big thing for me - but also a combination of poor diet, and excess amounts of caffiene.   I now work as a nurse. 12 hour shift work. But I dont have time to pull during work. I am too busy (physically and mentally). When I get home I am usually too exhausted to pull much before I fall asleep. I still take in a lot of caffiene and sugary food at times (damn break room treats!). My sleep schedule is not ideal. But i find that just being up on my feet is the biggest change. Sitting in a desk or in front of a laptop with the nagging stress of assignments has always been the worst trigger for me.  I'm not sure if that helps you narrow down your experience at all, and I really dont have solutions for you (maybe wear latex gloves while working on homework at home to reduce pulling?)

For me, I tend to pull the most sitting on the couch, driving in my car, or sitting at my desk. Once you know where you pull from, that will help you to start being more mindful of your pulling when youâ€™re in those locations.  Now itâ€™s time for an action plan. Do you pull watching TV? Make your hands busy when youâ€™re watching TV. Consider getting or making some fidget toys that satisfy the urge.   For eyelashes and eyebrows, I would encourage perhaps makeup to change the texture (texture change can help you realize youâ€™re pulling).   Lastly, it really helps to have the people in your life remind you of your pulling as well. Trust me, I know how difficult it is to admit to the people around you that you pull. However, it really is incredibly helpful to have the people around you say, â€œHey, youâ€™re pulling.â€ It snaps you out of your pulling daze.   If you havenâ€™t already, you can visit www.bfrb.org. They have resources to help you understand your body-focused repetitive behavior better. Good luck on your journey!\n",

      "we are not clinicians, and so we cannot diagnose you. There are other factors besides just hair pulling that are diagnostic for Trich specifically. A doctor would be able to provide a diagnosis.  Ask a teacher, or the parent of a trusted friend if they could advocate for you and help you in seeing the doctor if your parents are unable to help you.\n",

      "Oof, I am sorry to hear this.  You 100% have trich and it sucks in many ways but please know that it is not your fault and it does not define you.  In darker times you will likely obsess about it and be tempted to be angry at yourself.  But it is really just a chemical thing and it isn't your fault that your spot feel itchy and it is pulling the hairs that give relief.  You sound as young as many of us were when we started, and you have the disadvantage of having parents who are at least partially ignorant.  My recommendation to you is that you start by reading everything you can get your hands on about trich.  Do you have access to a public library and do you have a library card?  Librarians are great about confidentiality.  You can go to one and tell them you want to find books about trich and they can help you look them up and borrow them for free.  Your parents attitude towards therapy is wildly outdated.  Cognitive Behavior Therapy can help with trich.  There is nothing wrong with doing that therapy.  I encourage you to set a goal of educating yourself so much about Trich that you will be confident that you can eventually educate your parents about it.  What I mean by that is imagine that you spend months learning all about trich, what causes it, what treatments are being studied, and how important it is for family members to be supportive.  And then you present this information to your parents in a way that gets them to think, \"Holy shit, this isn't just a bad habit like picking her nose, this is a real and serious problem.\"    In my view your goal should be to get them to realize that they need to take this seriously.  Plenty of parents think that they can just belittle you into stopping.  They don't realize that it often makes things worse.  If you have more questions you can always come to this community or message us directly.  Hopefully in a few years you will be on your own and able to make your own decisions, including getting medical care for your condition.  Until then, learn what you can, and try to find some people you can trust to confide in and support each other.\n",

The IFG is related to behavioural inhibition, so choosing to stop a preplanned action as one example, or being forced to make a different action suddenly.   Interestingly the reverse is true in OCD, the IFG density is lower in this region, and in unaffected relatives of trich individuals there is also evidence for higher density in this area.

      "Sometimes we need a fresh start to try again. If shaving your head will allow you to have that reset mindset, than do it. I assume youâ€™ve tried many tactics to try to stop/reduce/redirect.   From my personal experience, Iâ€™ve never been able to stop completely but rather make it my goal to only pull certain areas and to leave the spots I get the most self conscious of alone.   Wearing a wig may feel great for you, and allow you to have that barrier preventing you from pulling your own hair. You can try oiling your real hair to make it too greasy to pull. Tape fingers/gloves. Distractions (I use rings to play with and keep my hands busy. Idle hands pull hair). I tell my close friend and family to tell me to stop if they see me (I do it without noticing). Exercise helps- Iâ€™ve done the drop and do 10 push-ups/squats if I catch myself pulling for relief/dopamine rush. Iâ€™ve tried keeping my nails either too long to grip hair or too short. I scratch or kind of stab the areas that are itchy and I want to pull and it helps relieve some of the pressure to pull (apparently we just enjoy pain). Having a good nights sleep helps a lot.   At the end of the day, the best thing you can do is forgive yourself. Tomorrow is a new day and you will keep trying. Itâ€™s a marathon, not a race. If you guilt yourself into feeling like a failure for buckling and pulling - chances are youâ€™ll throw in the towel and then pull the rest. Instead forgive the one and try distract/redirect.\n",

It actually gave me more ingrown hairs, but I was never good at applying the cream afterward, so that may be why. That being said, I HAVE used it as a replacement to tweezing. So when I want to pull, I use the epilator instead of tweezers. It pulls more hairs than tweezing, but it pulls them more... cleanly? If that makes sense? I get fewer infected ingrowns that way, and using a machine creates distance between me and the hair so I can't obsess over particular ones as much.

For me it was when I was anxious, stressed and sitting (like studying) and when I was doing watching tv/on my phone absent-minded. It helped to have some type of replacement behaviour that you start doing when youâ€™re in those situations and would normally result to hair pulling. My therapist recommended a stress ball or wrist taps or something. I ended up doing lip chewing which is bad in itself but at least Iâ€™m not pulling out 100s of hairs a day!

      "First of all, welcome. You've taken a massive step by writing this and I know how daunting that can be.   I relate to a lot of what you wrote. I've been pulling for 25 years, and there have been many, many times when I've felt completely helpless about it, like nothing works or that I have done myself too much damage. When my trich is at its worst, I feel like I am constantly pulling. I've pulled in yoga class! I have given myself bald patches, made myself bleed, and I know those feelings of shame and disgust very well.   Trich is a difficult thing to deal with, and I truly believe that having to fight it makes us stronger and more beautiful. That might sound cheesy, but I feel like a bit of an expert in trich these days. You are not disgusting.  There are a lot of things I've found that have helped me. This comment might get a bit lengthy, so I'm going to start by listing three resources that have been incredibly helpful, then say a bit about why/ the background, and then give you some suggestions for things you can do right now. It might feel a bit overwhelming to get so much info at once in which case I apologise - know that you can take things at your own pace and come back to them. You **can** tackle this but it does take a long time and it's not easy. There are lots of us here to suport you as you find what works for you.  * [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Overcoming-Body-Focused-Repetitive-Behaviors-Comprehensive-ebook/dp/B07MT5MP5Y) - I recommend it to everyone as I find it so helpful.   * [this blog](https://thetrichcoach.com/blog) - I don't know her, but I have had so many 'aha!' moments reading her words  * [The TLC foundation](https://www.bfrb.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=21&Itemid=34) - lots of useful information, and good links to share with other people if they don't understand what trich is.  One of the things that all of those have in common is an understanding that there's no 'silver bullet' for trich. You are not going to find one fidget toy or CBT technique that takes away the desire to pull.   What I've come to understand in tackling my own pulling is how many different purposes it serves: it's a retreat from 'difficult' feelings, a way of self-soothing, an expression of anger, and a very ingrained habit with well-worn neural pathways and bodily responses. Some of my pulling is done with intense concentration, other times it is essentially out of my awareness.  That being said, the number one thing that has helped me get a handle on pulling is raising my awareness of when I do it - tracking when I pull, where I am, what I am feeling/ thinking at the time, as well as tracking when I have urges to pull whether or not I act on them. That's what helped me realise that I am anxious WAY MORE than I would have thought and using pulling as a way to avoid thinking about things or to self soothe. And now I know that, I can do something about it!  I have also started taking [NAC](https://www.bfrb.org/learn-about-bfrbs/123-n-acetylcysteine-for-trichotillomania-skin-picking-and-nail-biting), which is an amino acid found to help reduce urges. I do feel it helps - and even if it's just a placebo, taking the pills each morning helps me set the intention to be mindful of my pulling.   I know what you mean about wanting the sensation of pain/ pulling on your scalp or wherever else you pull from, I am the same. Some things I've found helpful include keeping a hard-bristled brush or comb nearby and runnig it over/ pushing it into my head/ using a massager with solid points on my head, and using a product from Luh called 'Roots' that you rub into your scalp and it makes it tingle (it has the addedbenefit of apparently helping hair grow back).\n",

Everytime I went to get my hair cut, the hairdressers would always comment on how thick my hair is and jokingly tell me that I better tell my mom to leave a good tip, or tell me that I had enough hair for 2 people. This bothered me a lot because I was pretty fat as a kid and I'm already self conscious about taking up too much space, and now I'm being told that even my hair is taking too much space.   I distinctly remember my mom comment about me getting tons of hairfall after every hair cutting session. She probably thought I was allergic to a product they used or something. Thinking back, that was probably me pulling unconsciously, most likely triggered by those comments.\n",

      "Hey there, we're all with you. It's such a scary feeling not being able to stop. My trich started the same way with the twirling and later trying to find that hair that \"stood out\". I highly recommend not using any tools that will damage your hair and spend some time finding products to heal your hair and help it grow. I go through the same cycles of shaving off my head then I'm fine for a couple months till it starts again. This sub has been great for feeling like I'm not crazy and I'm not alone. Some tips I've found helpful are: cover your hair when you're idle (not busy with your hands/ watching TV/ reading a book, etc) silk scarfs work wonders and don't frizz up your hair. If you are gonna pull, set a timer for 5 minutes with a LOUD alarm, that's helped me when I go into trance-like states where ive lost hours without noticing and it snaps me out of it, as soon as that alarm sounds, get up from whatever you're currently doing and go to another room. If you live with relatives/family/friends/SO that knows about trich, be around them as much as possible. I don't pull in front of other people but when I do, they will gently remind me to stop and make me aware of my actions. It's a long battle but we will get through it :)\n",

My OCD started when I was little and my Mom, also a skin picker, took out her obsession on my arms with her sharp nails or the needles she used on my knees to pick at the bumps. I'd be forced to stand there for an hour while she picked at my keratin bumps or stuck needles in me claiming she did it so they wouldn't get infected. It was so horrible and painful but she didn't care. It started since I can remember as young as 4 and it stuck. I started taking over with the picking and she abused me regularly because of it. They'd make fun of me for my hair pulling and get angry at me for picking. My Mom would tell me she was embarrassed by all the marks.  I'm 41 and still suffer from this hell but I don't speak to my Mom so that's something.\n",

The bizarre itch/pain of the errant eyelash is something I never thought anyone else could relate to, yet this community does.   As for eyelash growth, in years past I did have success with Grande Lash serum. You have to give it a few weeks though. I am still nursing my daughter so I'm not currently using it as it's not been tested on nursing women, but once I am done with that I'm going to start with this again and then also use techniques I've seen on this sub to help beat the urges. I'm currently using Castor oil but it's only been a week or so, so I don't expect to see any results for a while.   I also bought a fidget toy that I try to play with at my desk so that I don't idly pull and irritate my lashes. It helps a bit.

      "You're not alone in the slightest.  Tons of us out here!    I used to have the same issue with my eyelashes and my eyebrows and then I realized I can pencil in my eyebrows but I can't do anything if I have no eyelashes - I'm a guy.  So, I just focused on pulling from my eyebrows anytime I needed a little \"fix\" of whatever the chemical is that pulling creates.  Over time I've focused more on pulling from my ears (socially acceptable) and eyebrows and just told myself my eyelashes are off limits.  Over the years I've tried dozens of supports and remedies.  For me I find that if I never touch my eyelashes I will never know there is a bad hair that needs to go.  In other words, if I touch that hair -- I'm done for and will have to pull it.  BUT, if I keep my hands from idly touching there I have a much better chance of succeess,  Also, I made a deal with myself that if I have to pull a hair I will do it in front of a mirror with a tweezers so I only get that one bad one.  If I pull sitting at my desk I often go on a bender and make a bald spot.  I also like/use the Pavlok shock bracelet, and I got these plastic fingertip things for under $10 that I like - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CHUE4IU/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1  Also I find that reading books about Trich really helps me focus and feel not alone.  There are several of them and they're all quite good.  Get one!  Lastly, my most important advice to you is to stop treating this as such a big deal, if you can possibly do so.  You are freaking yourself out unnecessarily.  It is really not that big a deal that you have this problem. Lots of people do.  I have been dealing with it for 30+ years and when I was young I felt like you did.  Now I realize that it's really just cosmetic and also it isn't my fault that my damn hairs itch so much.  Sometimes I pull and I feel bad about it but damn it feels so good and in that moment I need it.  I have a very happy life now and you can too.

Help with short term anxiety, and if you really truly have no problem with it or even like it, it doesnâ€™t hurt you, so I think itâ€™s ok. In the meantime he can go to therapy and hopefully by the time you have a pixie again, he has learned some coping skills and wonâ€™t be so nervous to see your hair.  Maybe other ideas, like finding ways to calm him and get his mind off of your hair (a bath, a scent that he likes, a movie, a weighted blanket, play-dough, maybe a combination of some of these or other ideas) should be tried first, THEN move to shave the hair if those donâ€™t work. Also, Iâ€™d ask him this exact question youâ€™ve asked us and let him brainstorm. Say, what can we try to do to help you feel better? Because he knows how to calm himself down and occupy his hands better than any of us strangers on the internet. Good luck !!!\n",

And whatever you do - donâ€™t pick at the wounds! But if you canâ€™t help it, start the process over with tea tree.    This is super normal for sufferers of trich. I know how embarrassing it is. Tackling my mental health, mainly my anxiety, was the most helpful thing for me, much more helpful than trying to deal with the trich directly. For me it was a symptom of a larger problem.

I told them to only give me my tweezers for 15 mins max at a time to clean up my eyebrows/facial hair when needed & then take them back   4. Set timers on my phone for grooming. If shaving for example only needs to take 10 mins, I'll set an alarm for 10 mins then clean up & leave the bathroom.   5. Since one of my triggers is liking to pull late at night when I'm alone & bored instead of sleeping, I'll make sure that I'm in bed with the lights off every day at the same time. I can happily still lay in bed for hours on my phone scrolling through social media, posting on forums, playing games, etc. but the lights must be off.   6. After my hair re grows completely (since at the moment I'm going to shave every 3-4 days to let the hair grow out since it's essentially that same wait period as waxing) I'm going to shave every day & apply unscented deodorant (if I can shave my armpits everyday to avoid stubble, why not down there so I'm not even tempted?)

Provide them with context about how this is a quite common issue that millions of people quietly deal with and it's just a minor crossing of wires that makes certain hairs really itchy sort of like a really bad mosquito bite.  In the end if she is weirded out about it too much then that sucks but it is better to know now so you can move on.

      "I have this same issue too!  They're actually sebaceous filaments (SF's), not blackheads.  SF's are a built-up plug of keratin, sebum, and possibly other dirt and oils.  I get them on my chest, neck, under my lip, all over my nose, and on my forehead/in between my eyebrows.  Most of what people call \"blackheads\" are really just SF's.  They usually form inside a pore around a small hair.  Pretty much everyone has them, the size just varies.  They will always fill back up, so there is no permanent solution, besides maybe a skin transplant.  The only option is to manage them, GENTLY- because the skin on your chest is very fragile, so picking will only make the pores more noticeable (I have definitely caused permanent damage to my hush bubbs from picking).    As far as scarring, I would personally suggest The Ordinary's Rosehip Oil, the smallest bottle of Bio-Oil (a little goes a long way; they sell it at Walgreens if you are in the US), or vitamin E oil, applied at night after whatever moisturizer (all should be under $10 if I'm correct).  Rosehip oil and Bio-Oil are non-comedogenic, never caused any additional acne or clogged pores for me, but IDK about vitamin E.     Neosporin helps really well for bad scabs that you know will scar.  Also, sunscreen or an SPF-containing lotion during the day will prevent scars from darkening.  I encourage you to check out r/SkincareAddiction for more advice and tips, but I will share what has worked for me, and try to explain *why* it has helped.  The routine I follow has gained a bit of attention recently, and if you go on r/SkincareAddiction and maybe r/beauty, you can see people's before and after pics (I'm kinda on a roll right now so I'll link them in this thread if I find them later).  I do this in the morning, to my chest, neck, and face before my skincare, after washing face and other areas with water:  -Stridex Pads Maximum Strength (red box): This product was hard for me to accept into my routine because of how it destroyed my skin when I was a pimply youth, but if it is used right, it can definitely help.  The active ingredient is 2% salicylic acid, a Beta Hydroxy Acid, which is really good at penetrating pores and breaking up gunk.  You can find other BHA products, but Stridex is really effective for about $4 a jar (also Stridex has no alcohol, unlike other brands of pads I've seen).  Anyways, I dab/wipe a few pads all over the areas, so that they are damp enough to know that the product is on them, and then I let it sit to dry for 20 min.  -After 20 min, I apply a clay mask to the areas, without rinsing the Stridex off.  I use Aztec Healing Clay or something, I don't remember the name, but I mix it myself.  I don't know if this step is as important as the others, but it feels nice.  The mask is somewhat drying, but it is gentle enough not to irritate sensitive areas that I have picked.  I leave the mask on for 10-15 min to dry, then rinse off with water and pat myself dry with a clean towel.   -Now for the fun part:  Lastly, I take my rosehip oil (but you can use any gentle, non-comedogenic, medium-thickness carrier oil), saturate the entirety of the areas, and let it sit for at least 15 min without rubbing it in (I know, it feels gross, and this is a loooong process, but it is way worth it).  Then, I start to gently massage, push, and swirl the areas with my fingers.  I begin to feel little bumps and plugs loosen and feel like squishy sand underneath my fingers.  These are the SF's coming out!!  I find that I need to apply a few more drops of oil during this process, because I start to feel resistance, and the pulling and tugging can lead to broken capillaries.  I don't massage for more than 5 min, so I don't damage my skin.  Afterward, I wash the oil and plugs off my skin with a gentle face cleanser, and then follow with my regular skincare routine.    These pores will refill quickly, like within a few days, but you should notice an immediate difference in appearance whenever you do this.  I don't do this \"treatment\" more than once a week, because it can put too much stress on the skin, but it is the most gentle way I know of to actually extract and reduce the appearance of SF's, especially compared to picking!  I have no redness whatsoever from doing this.  This is a super long comment, but I hope that it helps!  I understand the hopelessness and frustration, so I wish you luck!!!!!!!\n",

      "You came to the right place and there are so many people here who can relate!  Maybe try to pick one spot that you wonâ€™t pick. Just one body part or even just one specific scab and try as hard as you can to just avoid that spot. if you start on that one spot, move to any other â€˜allowedâ€™ area. Maybe even put neosporin on that spot and bandage it up.  Maybe over time youâ€™ll start to feel some tiny element of control over it, and then build on that. Right now it probably feels completely insurmountable, I think starting with a really small goal may be helpful?  This strategy helped when I wanted to stop with my fingers..

Itâ€™s been so difficult to stop for me because most of the time I donâ€™t even realize that Iâ€™m picking until itâ€™s too late. I actually just got some press on fake nails the other day to prevent myself from picking and let my scalp heal up completely. Itâ€™s only been two days, but itâ€™s definitely working because the nails are a lot less sharp than my natural nails so it makes picking much more difficult. Even when my hand gravitate towards my scalp, I can feel the nails and they act as a reminder to stop. I donâ€™t really have many tips to give you as Iâ€™m still trying to break this habit myself. I started washing my hair more often a few months ago to keep the wounds clean so I would recommend washing your hair every day or every other day if arenâ€™t already doing so. Iâ€™ve heard other people recommend wearing hats or mittens when youâ€™re just hanging around the house, so you could give that a try. If you live with someone and are comfortable doing so, you could ask them to remind you not to pick or tell you to stop picking if they see you doing it. You could get some fidget toys or find something that you already have to keep your hands busy. For me, the more idle my hands are, the more likely I am to pick.\n",

      "Hey!  You are not alone - not even close.    I'm probably 30 years ahead of you and I can tell you that it can and likely will get much better.    First, you will feel so much better when you tell your partner.  I guarantee it.  I was terrified to tell my girlfriend (now wife) and when I did I acted like it was a big terrible secret I had to disclose and when I told her that I have trich and I can't stop pulling out my hairs she said something like, \"That's your big secret you were worried about?  I thought you were going to tell me that you killed a guy or had cancer.\"  When I was in college it got so bad that I pulled out my eyebrows entirely.  I looked like an insane freak.  I thought I would never find happiness or love or success.  I was super wrong.  Over the years I've found all three, and you can too.  Everybody needs to find their own way to cope with trich. There is no magic bullet.  I did cognitive behavior therapy, read numerous books, take NAC, use Pavlok shock bracelet, and have trained myself to pull mostly from socially acceptable places like my ears.  But it is still a struggle.  I've also realized that the same drive that causes me to want to pull hairs out can be channeled into other parts of my life. Of being relentlessly focused on completing tasks and being the best at many things.  I'm happy to give you examples privately and correspond with you if that might help.  For now, I think it is extremely likely that your boyfriend will react just fine if you tell him that you want to tell him about a medical issue you are dealing with.  Tell him that it isn't contagious but you struggle with the overwhelming urge to pull your hair out in certain places in your body.  That it itches ten times worse than the worst mosquito bite and its nearly impossible for you to not scratch and pull.  Explain to him that the syndrome is fairly common though not widely discussed because many people who suffer from it are embarrassed by it.   Maybe let him read this thread or copy and paste some answers to protect your screen name.  But in either case, your boyfriend likely very much wants to have sex with you and if you do too, hopefully you can tell him that you have been worrying so much about telling him about your trich and you'd understand if he is less attracted to you but you sure would like to get naked, pronto.      Good luck!\n",

      "That was so sad to read and I'm so sorry you're feeling this way. You have a problem you didn't ask for that is NO FAULT of your own. You need help and support taking it one day at a time and one step at a time. I  don't  have trichotillomania myself, but I have an ex boyfriend who had it pretty bad (i becamea pro at grooming evening out his brows when he had nearly bald spots), and I've got bipolar 2 which sometimes causes my manic anxiety to make me have temporary but intense phases of dermatillamania that most often made worse by psoriasis. It sucks. I don't pull hairs, but I will mindlessly pick at my skin aggressively until I realize I'm bleeding. Some days my upper arms, forearms, calves and upper thighs are bloody and swollen because my anxiety makes me dig my nails into into them without me even realizing it. Let me tell you, it's incredibly embarrassing to admit I do that to myself, and I absolutely understand how easy it is to blame yourself and hate yourself for doing it because sometimes I hate myself too -- but you're not powerless against this!   Set small goals like no hair pulling for 2 days. Like, ZERO hair pulling. Once 2 days of zero pulling isn't as challenging as it was, make your next goal 5 days of no pulling, and so on. It's okay to have failed attempts, and it's okay to have setbacks. Just shake it off and try again. Hair grows back! Eventually it will start getting easier little by little, and eventually you'll get to a place where you've developed a lot more control over the compulsion to pull your hairs. With time, you'll start learning ways to preemptively avoid pulling hairs when you're stressed because you'll learn to recognize the signs of a trichotillomania phase creeping up on you.   As far as your concerns with your boyfriend, I  think being honest about it as soon as realistically possible it is all it'll take to help him understand. While you're definitely struggling with something that's hard to cope with, you're actively working hard on changing that and taking steps to get better, and that's a really impressive thing. And you know what else? That's also brave and really badass! Your boyfriend will more than likely understand, empathize, and be supportive of your goal to gain control of your situation. After all, you're a human being with a lot more to offer than a pristine pubic area. Why would he reject you over something like that? Even if your pubic area looks like a scabby warzone right now, so what? ALL OF THAT WILL HEAL IF YOU ALLOW IT, and you CAN do it.   Something that's helped me tremendously with my dermatillamania is getting into skincare. I love seeing the results of all my scars fading, I love how much softer and healthier my skin is, and I love knowing that I made that happen instead of inflicting damage on my skin like I usually did. What do you think might be something that helps you want to focus on some well deserved self care and distract you from pulling? Once your lady parts heal up and theres no more scabs, do you think getting your bikini area waxed would help since there wouldn't be anything to pull for 2-4 weeks and you could give your skin and your trichotillomania a much needed break? That might be a great options. And trust me, estheticians and people who do waxing sooooo don't  care about seeing scars in your pubic area, especially if you tell them what they're from. Pubic area scars are very, very common because so many people struggle with chronic ingrown hairs and shaving nicks.  In fact, they'll probably be very understanding and supportive of your situation. If you're clean and polite, you've got nothing to worry about. They look at different vulvas, vaginas, butt cracks and buttholes every day. They're professionals who understand skin in those areas can be very sensitive and prone to problems. I promis you that what you have going on with your lady parts is NOTHING compared to people who aren't clean down there and still expect to get waxed. Don't feel embarrassed! They're there to help you, not judge you.   I don't know where you live or what your resources are, but I think talking to a professional who treats things like this could help you a lot. I'm sure they'd know things we don't  know. But if that's not an option right now, then you're going to have to buckle down and rely on yourself.   If you have any hyperpigmentation from pulling that you don't like, there's a whole bunch of great products on the market than can speed healing and gently fade scars. I can recommend some products (that I do not sell, only use) I've had success with if you're interested. I've had to repair so much self inflicted damage and fade so many scars I learned what works.  But overall, the most important  thing is be good to yourself right now. You deserve to be happy. The stress from hating yourself will only make you wanna pull more. Start taking small steps toward your goal of not pulling and celebrate every milestone, because every milestone matters.   Your boyfriend will not reject you, you are not a broken person, and you can beat this! I'm rooting for you â¤   Edit: For now, get rid of your tweezers!\n",

      "Yea! It helped me to know that it was real. I originally joined a Facebook group for support but after a while I found it either triggering or a little depressing.   For me it helps to not just say I had to stop but try start off by reducing it. I donâ€™t know the best strategies for dermatillomania. But especially now with the stress of quarantine, I cover my hair at home. I either it wrap it with a scarf or wear a hat. I will often put a treatment like coconut oil underneath. If you use a treatment remember to wash it off before bed or cover your pillow. Coconut oil takes 2 shampoos to get it out.   I have to remind myself that the best way to help it grow is to reduce my pulling. It took me a few years to honestly tell a friend or two. It helped because then I could celebrate improvements.   Another helpful thing for me has been taking regular photos on my laptops photo booth. I donâ€™t do it as much now because I am not using my laptop as much. It really helps me to see my progress and also appreciate that even if I am not where I want to be, my hair has been healthy and long before. Maybe it an be long again. I was almost bald last year and forgot how bad it was until I looked at my photos. It really helped me feel proud of myself.   I totally get it! Feel free to DM!\n",

There are a lot of random plants that are popping up - some are weeds, others are edible. I find it extremely satisfying not only pulling weeds, but IDing plants from their seedlings and deciding which weeds can grow alongside the veggies I actually intended to grow. There is a lot of parsley, lemon balm, chard, borage, etc. just kinda growing wild alongside the kale and tomatoes and spinach that I planted on purpose. And growing food to eat from seeds, planning things out, observing the plant growth, watching the garden thrive, it all feels really good.\n",

      "Hi there! If you haven't yet, I recommend checking out bfrb.org. Hair pulling (trichotillomania) and skin picking (dermotillomania, excoriation disorder) are both body focused repetitive disorders. They are on the obsessive compulsive spectrum, but have a few differences from actual OCD.   Primary \"treatment\" level responses are cognitive behavioral therapy, habit reversal training, and an amino acid called N-acetylcysteineÂ (NAC).   Steps to take include identifying triggers for pulling (thoughts, emotions, time of day/location, physical stimuli/feel of hairs, visual stimuli/seeing the hairs, scalp itchiness), minimizing triggers if possible (processing and developing thoughts and emotions; setting timers in the bathroom; covering mirrors; wearing hats, gloves, or bandaids; shaving or otherwise removing body/facial hair; sometimes even shaving the head; skincare treatment for dryness, oiliness, or itchiness) becoming more mindful when you catch yourself pulling or about to pull (having someone else point it out, buzzer bracelet, snapping a wristband when you catch yourself, tracking pulling in a journal or app), replacing the pulling with other habits (fidget/sensory toys, crafts, exercise), and exposure therapy (meditating while touching the hair without pulling).    Another big component is managing your appearance so that you can look as good as possible despite any bald spots. This increases confidence and can help with some of the distress that gets in the way of getting better. Lots of good tips for that on this subreddit if you start browsing.   Accepting that having trich doesn't make you a horrible person and doesn't define you is a good place to start. Guilt and shame can be big triggers for more pulling, and they also just suck in general.   Although completely stopping is recognized as very difficult and not something that happens for everybody, there are definitely success stories. You can find encouraging stories on this subreddit and at bfrb.org. And any improvement in quality of life is good!\n",

But itâ€™s always in the same desirable area.

The hair elsewhere is more likely to get ingrown, harder to pull, and less satisfying.    Always amazed how fast it grows back.    Do you get focused on the roots and hope for the big ones?   If so no doubt you have trich.   But yeah I simply pull everywhere.  Itâ€™s bonus if itâ€™s unwanted hair and I donâ€™t have to worry about it looking weird.\n",

When I was younger I always did have the time. I definitely donâ€™t suffer because of it. It doesnâ€™t adversely effect me. It benefits me, the result is pleasing to me. I relate so strongly to the â€œtranceâ€ though. I could go at it for 1-3 hours. My back would hurt after. Thatâ€™s half the appeal though (the trance) other than the satisfaction of the hair pulling and the pimple popping-esque nature of it. (Something that I did once compulsively do and it definitely adversely affect me). But all in all. I think itâ€™s just my preferred method of pubic hair removal that I just so happen to weirdly enjoy to a huge extent.

      "I used to get these too, they are the worst. Iâ€™m not sure about the medical aspect of this, and itâ€™s probably worth looking into first before trying, but I used to put Neosporin on sores or ingrown hairs. Not only do I think it helped them heal, but the Vaseline like texture made it undesirable I touch and harder to pull anything. They also had a Neosporin + Pain relief that would slightly numb the area, which would also tame the sensation that would keep bringing me back. I donâ€™t think it would be good to use all the time, but I would use it when it was really bad.    I would love to hear a medical professionalâ€™s opinion on this before recommending it to anyone, but it definitely helped me.\n",

      "Absolutely not a bad idea! I remember the day I told my girlfriend; we were 16/17 at the time. I was terrified, like you at that point I hadnâ€™t really told anyone besides my parents and therapist. It didnâ€™t seem to bother her at all, and I couldnâ€™t even describe the feeling of relief. Like you said though, it is a bit of a double edged sword, because now you are comfortable to pull in front of him; but the benefits of sharing FAR outweigh the consequences of being comfortable. I will tell anyone about my pulling, keeping it a secret was such a burden to carry. I feel less of a prisoner to it without having to hide it. I definitely pulled more because it it at times; where I otherwise wouldnâ€™t have felt comfortable, but that also shows that you have the ability to control it! If you can not pull out of fear of someone seeing you, that means you can not pull just for yourself! You just have to figure out how to rewire your brain to let you do that. Itâ€™s very possible.  By the way, my girlfriend is now my wife, and mother of my two wonderful children. That story was over 13 years ago. I also donâ€™t really pull anymore. I will always be a puller, and I only recently stopped the last spot I still pulled; but it doesnâ€™t own me like it did for so long. It is very possible to get here! It may just take some time.\n",

So basically, it's a stim, but in doing the \"soothing\" action, it causes increased anxiety, making you need to stim more. For ASD/ADHD we're encouraged to find a replacement soothing stim.

      "Hi, I'm a disability studies major who's done a lot of research into the mental health aspect of things. Pulling creates a feedback loop of obsession and compulsion (since I think technically body-focused repetitive behaviours are a part of the OCD family) that causes you to think about it or fixated on it, and it causes stress, so when you do the thing you're compelled to do to relieve the stress, your brain rewards you. Then you want to do it more, so you'll get rewarded more. I honestly treat my trich like an addiction fuelled by OCD in terms of the psychology of it. The more you pull, the more you'll want to pull to feel that fabricated reward. It's also partially a sensory thing, which not a lot of the research touches on.   Imo it should never be considered self harm if it's in the obsessive/compulsive cycle, only if it's express purpose is to punish oneself like traditional self harm.\n",

      "*Ungh*  Sorry to hear you've had multiple bad experiences with therapists / would-be-helpers.   I do think it's fair to say that a 'typical' psychiatrist is not likely to remember many of their clients' names -- the way the medical system is setup (here in the U.S.) incentivises numbers over people -- many psychiatrists these days are expected to see 3 patients an hour, 7hours a day, 35hrs/wk  = 105 people / week...  Not sure that helps to explain your particular experience, and it certainly doesn't 'excuse' the systemic failure underpinning the personal (professional) failure of that provider.  Your former talk therapist however, certainly has no excuse.  More important than all that though, at this point, it sounds like you know what you're looking for (from a potential therapist), and I would *strongly* encourage you to be unequivocal in seeking out the therapist that you need at this time.  Finding a good therapist is as much about your own articulation & resolve to achieve particular ends through the work of the therapy itself, as it is about whom the therapist actually is . . .   Ok, that's likely to be confusing.  Maybe a better way of putting it:  the more you know about what you'd like to address AND who you'd like to become (in as concrete terms as possible, e.g. \"I want to be generally easier-going, day-to-day\"  the more likely you'll be able to both define what you're looking for with whatever therapist you try, and the more likely you'll be able to know, relatively quickly, whether the therapist you've found is the right one for you in this phase of your life.

      "I actually am really similar to this, I definitely get this crawling uncomfortable feeling, like I HAVE to do whatever it is I'm thinking about. Even though there's not really any thought or reason for it.   For example, I have a popsocket on my phone, and sometimes when I touch it, I have to run my fingers all the way around it, so it's not like only part of it was touched. Every part needs to be touched the same amount. The biggest issue for me though is just generally picking at things, like my skin, or my scalp, or my eyebrows. Or rubbing my nails against each other over and over again, making sure I go over the entire edge. Whatever it is, it's always with the same crawling, anxious feeling.   The compulsions are definitely a lot worse the more stressed I am, like they're comforting.  I was actually recently evaluated, and I talked to my doctor about these compulsions. He said he actually didn't really think this is indicative of OCD exactly, as intrusive thoughts are usually one of the biggest parts, because they cause you to do the things. He said it's a lot more likely that I have a general Body-Focused Repetitive Behavior Disorder (which is kind of an OCD-adjacent condition), worsened by my ADHD. Perhaps you could look into that, seeing as we seem to have similar feelings behind our compulsions.  Just a suggestion though! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not a doctor, but I agree with the other commenter. It does sound like it may be a symptom of OCD, but many different issues can present in similar ways/with similar symptoms.   This is why it helps a lot to talk with a doctor, and maybe get a referral for mental health services (if you haven't already). Professionals can really help to look for the deeper roots to your symptoms, and often help you realize other symptoms that you didn't even realize were abnormal.  For example, I have some issues with compulsions similar to yours, where I pick at things a lot. While this seems like it could be OCD, for me it's actually indicative of a body focused repetitive behavior disorder, which is connected to OCD, but not quite the same.   Regardless of whether you have OCD or not, this definitely sounds like it is deeply impacting your life and causes you a lot of stress. That in itself is enough for treatment to be worth looking into.\n",

      "I help take care of my parents, my Dad just turned 85 and is subject to illness anyway. To compound matters, I work at a hotel, so I'm regularly exposed to people from all over, and if that isn't bad enough, damn coronavirus has been detected right in my area, so pretty much highest risk scenario possible. Let's just add insult to injury, my Dad is flying back home today. So you can imagine, every time I cough, or sneeze, every random sniffle I get is almost a mini panic attack. I don't worry about myself, I'm in good health and I'm not afraid of self quarantine, but the concern that I'm going to spread it to someone who isn't healthy is at the forefront of my mind. I'm trying to alleviate my tendency to overthinking, and just trying to do the recommended steps, I've been keeping my hands clean, not touching my face, staying away from other people, and avoiding public spaces. At work I'm sanitizing the public area and trying to be as smart as possible about the whole situation. This is the most I figured I can do on my own to prevent things. I intend to keep my distance from my parents anyway, while doing as much as I can to help them, and again, practicing good sanitation habits, so worst case, if I happen to get it, hopefully I'll keep it contained to myself, and won't need to worry about what I didn't do. I know obsessing over it isn't going to help myself or anyone else, but I have to admit, like I said, if I get a minor sniffle, I'm tempted to panic about it, and they more time goes by, the worse this gets.

      "Hey I know this reply is pretty late, but I see no one else has replied here so I thought I'd give you some feed back.  I don't know if you've ever talked to your parents seriously about your behavior concerns, but you should absolutely see a doctor and/or a psychiatrist about these. A general practitioner can help you rule out any physical issues you might have that could be causing this and can usually recommend a psychiatrist to help you get an evaluation.  I noticed that, besides mentioning the normalcy of your family like, you don't seem to mention having any sort of feelings or emotions about the behaviors you have. Do they bother you? Make you upset? Sad? Angry? Embarrassed? It's just an interesting thing to note because it seems like they distress you enough to make a post about them, but you don't actually articulate any emotions.  Because a lot of the disorders you've brought up can have vague symptoms and can be co-morbid (meaning they can exist in the same person at the same time), it's pretty difficult for us to give you specific advice about what could be causing your issues. From what you've described though, I think an in-person evaluation by a qualified professional is absolutely warranted and you can feel confident that seeing a psychiatrist makes total sense in this situation. And that psychiatrist may in turn recommend you see a psychologist, which I think would probably be warranted here as well.  Sometimes getting help can be difficult, but I really think you should push the matter and really try to see someone about this.\n",

      "As someone who unconsciously pulls my head hair, I've never paid much mind to the hairs I've pulled unless they've become a pile I need to pickup or have somehow static-clinged themselves to my clothing. Otherwise they get pulled out and thrown away without a second thought. When I DO find them I feel the same sort of gross feeling I've always had about finding hair, pre-trich.   I see a lot of posts like this of people taking pictures of their hair and/or otherwise collecting it in ways I would never think to do, and other people saying the images trigger them to pull (which I also don't experience at all). It makes me wonder about the different drives we all have for pulling and how it almost seems like there are different spectrums for obsession and compulsion that we all lie on (like me being 100% compulsive, but not being driven by any sort of obsession or even really any awareness of my hair at all). Perhaps this implies, despite all having the same symptom of pulling hair, the causes might be quite different.  This is just a thought I've been having as I've seen these posts and reading the discussions about them and having trouble relating to some experiences others are having.\n",

      "NEOSPORIN. Seriously, if you've broken skin or drawn blood, you want an anti-infection agent. The active ingredient in Neosporin is bacitracin, which can be found as a generic for a lower price. I use a tiny piece of (clean!) toilet paper to stop the bleeding, then add a dab of ointment and cover with a band-aid if possible. (You can also use a bit of a tissue and some scotch tape if you're in a pinch.)   If you have a wound that has started being infected (pus in the wound, greenish scab, growing red skin around the wound) you need to treat it further. Pour some hydrogen peroxide over it - it will bubble up (and it will sting!) and eat away any infected tissues at the wound site. Then you pat it dry and bandage as described above.  And as always, if you have redness that extends along a vein or grows in size over a short period of time, see a doctor!

      "Hey there, fellow puller/picker here. It took me three therapists to find someone who had heard of trich, but that doesn't mean therapy can't help. Many colleges have counselors on campus that can be seen for free or at low rates. I did that when I was in college and it really helped me out! And I hear you on the mom-calling-for-therapy thing, mine can talk for ten minutes straight without a break in the conversation!  As for words of encouragement: I know how it feels to have scars 'down south'. It's not pretty, but it's not the end of the world either. As long as you keep any wounds clean and use ointments when appropriate, the only lasting effects are how you feel about them - which you have the power to control! You don't have to love your scars, but you can think of them as testaments to your fight against this disorder and your strength in coming this far. This is the most stressful month of the most stressful year of the most stressed-out generation - feeling anxious and depressed right now is nothing to be ashamed of, heck, it's normal! Everyone has a different way to cope, and for us that's body-focused repetitive disorders.

      "Welcome!!!  Keeping your hands busy is a huge help; and there are many ways to do that; like previously mentioned embroidering or video games are great examples. If itâ€™s on your head maybe a comb or brush to help curb the urges/sensation rather than your hands. Also, the habit of searching for hair, and pulling it out, are two different things. As Iâ€™m sure you know, mindless searching results in almost impossible to stop pulling. So itâ€™s easier to try and prevent the searching than it is to stop the pulling once youâ€™re already there. I used to say â€œheadâ€ out loud anytime I would touch my head; even if it was not to pull. I said it out loud to train my self to be aware anytime I did it. After weeks of doing this it became habit to say this, even if it was no longer out loud but just in my head. This helped me be present and aware when my hands were near my head, and ultimately gave me that moment of clarity needed to be able to move my hands and not start searching. There are all kinds of different tricks to retrain your brain to create habits that can help you. They just take repetition and time. Let me know if you want help coming up with more specific ideas! Habits can be a power tool if you can start training yourself to use them to your advantage!   And most importantly, always remember itâ€™s OK that you pull. Donâ€™t beat yourself up! Everyone has things they struggle with, and youâ€™re not alone. NEVER beat yourself up about what you have done; take notes, learn, and move on stronger than before! Loving yourself will give you the strength and serenity you need to overcome this challenge.\n",

      "Hi! Yes you do need a rx for latisse, it is usually still expensive even with the prescription. But there are some online subscriptions health suppliers that will arrange for youto have a telehealth appointment and get an rx and have it delivered if youâ€™re interested. One service that does this is called Rory.  Otherwise, a dermatologist can prescribe it for, may even be able to give you a very small sample if youâ€™re lucky.  I have used it when I wasnâ€™t having issues with pulling my lashes to help encourage their regrowth, and it really helped. They came back in fuller and darker and got long very quickly- however it wonâ€™t last if you pull them out again of course! And as I mentioned the product is expensive. So I would be sure you are at a good place where you feel like you wonâ€™t be pulling them out immediately.

      "I also get those bumps or inflamed follicles/ ingrown scalp hairs from time to time and it will totally aggravate my pulling and cause a hot spot in that area. Iâ€™ll echo what the previous posters have said. I think my hands and fingers pulling frequently contribute to infecting the follicles after Iâ€™ve pulled the hair probably. I usually clean the area with rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide and apply a little neosporin to the spot. In the shower Iâ€™ll use Tsal or some shampoo with salicylic acid to exfoliate the scalp and keep dead skin or product/ dirt and sweat from clogging the pores and causing the ingrown hairs. Besides the Tsal I also like briogeo charcoal micro scalp scrub. I also use nizoral 1-2x a week to prevent a fungal infection in those sores/ ingrowns since I have my hands and fingers all over them as I mentioned before.\n",

      "Hi there! Itâ€™s good that youâ€™re reaching out. Iâ€™ve had trichotillomania and some of the behaviors you described for a very long time. Iâ€™ve been pulling/twirling my hair since I was little 5/6 years old, I also started picking at my head and creating scabs and picking at them when I was probably 10/11... and again in my teenage years. I also have the problem of biting my lips/cheeks to the point you can tell something is wrong, theyâ€™ll be swollen with bite marks or bleeding.   It does sound like some sort of OCD similar to trich. Iâ€™m not sure if you do actually pull your hair, but these are all very similar behaviors & often people with trich do these things as well. I would see a psychiatrist or therapist to see if they can work with you for heathy coping mechanisms and ways to better manage your stress. I would comment on ideas, but Iâ€™m sure there are many in this thread and I donâ€™t consider myself an expert as I am now turning 22 in a few days, and am making backwards progress as we speak.

      "TW: picking, scabs/scars, blood  Hey there - I've been in the same situation as you before. It's so hard when you know you're injuring yourself but you can *just* see the hair and want to get it out. I actually dealt with this a couple weeks ago, created a spot and had to work to keep it disinfected. I would go at it for a half hour and only have blood on my hands to show for it. It finally healed over and the hair started to grow out of it - and it came out in *one pull*. I realized that if I had just waited a bit longer, I could've saved myself a lot of pain (and a scar). I know it's difficult to think like that in the moment, but it helps me to remember that when I see other embedded hairs that I want to go after. Sometimes time is the best medicine!  As for actual medicine, do you have any hydrogen peroxide? Running that over the wound can help eat away the infected portions of the area. (It will also sting, FYI.) I'd also recommend bacitracin (the active ingredient in Neosporin) for infection control - I don't know if coconut oil is correct or healthy in this case. Above all, you need to leave that area alone for a while. Hide your tweezers, put a cloth over your lap at the toilet, shower in the dark if that's a trigger. Use all the tools at your advantage to leave that spot alone until it heals. I know that's so hard to do, but try as best as you can!  Finally, I want to say that it's okay for you to have difficult emotions over this, but you are not mandated to feel shame. Trich has a high mental and anxiety component, and with how this week has gone you have every right to be stressed. Confiding in your partner can be one way to vent your emotions and have someone to talk to about your issues. You don't have to go into detail about the specifics (\"I'm pulling more often than usual and could use support\" is perfectly fine) and having a friend to talk with about it might help curb the edge off your picking stress.   Above all, know that you are loved, you are worthy of being loved, and trich will not stop you from becoming the person you want to be. We're here for you. â™¥ï¸\n",

In my experience sharing has always been extremely rewarding, and it takes the pressure of it being a secret away; which is a huge relief. Also, Neosporin always worked great for me, and the oily texture kept me from messing with it. I also used to use Neosporin + Pain Relief, it kind of numbs the area and can help dull the sensations that try to bring you back. Iâ€™m not a doctor so make sure itâ€™s safe before you use anything, but I donâ€™t see why it wouldnâ€™t, and I used it for years. Good luck! Keep your chin up! Make sure to compliment yourself!

Also idk if you do this but keeping a written record actually helped a lot. I would like use  colour coded stickers in my agenda to keep track. Green - no incidents. Yellow - one incident/less than an hr. Red- multiple incidents or one incident that was longer than an hr. Blue - anxiety/panic inducing event. Red and blue naturally accompanied each other a lot.

The extra difficulty is enough to remind me when Iâ€™m starting to slip into an episode.    I just keep about 10 of these â€œglove fingersâ€ in my pocket at all times and just take them off to eat and stuff.  They are not uncomfortable, and I can still seem to use my iPhone touchscreen fine without taking them off.  Hang in there - donâ€™t beat yourself up if you slip up.  Reward yourself for small victories.\n",

      "Hi there - welcome to the party! By definition, a mental illness is an action or habit that negatively impacts your life (or in the case of something like narcissism, those around you). If you are uncomfortable with your pulling, the scars that form, or the attention it draws, then I'd say you have trichotillomania/dermatillomania. I know how you feel regarding having sores all over - my bikini line will likely have scars for years. It really sucks, and I'm sorry you're going through it.   Please feel free to check out the resources available on this sub. There are tips and tricks for fighting the urge, redirecting 'fidget' energy to less-destructive habits/objects, and just being able to vent to people who understand what you're going through. (Also, just my two cents, I totally support dyeing your hair. If it's the white hairs that bother you, dye might help you squash that urge!)   We're all here for you - feel free to post anytime if you want help or support. *hug*\n",

      "I donâ€™t remember writing this post ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜‚ Itâ€™s very relatable  Itâ€™s a really hard thing to stop. Iâ€™ve been pulling since I was like 7 and stopped at 12 and only recently continued at age 18, Iâ€™m turning 19 very soon. I was suffering through OCD / anxiety which meant I did it through stressful situation and medication helped. Now I just do it when Iâ€™m bored which isnâ€™t great.  I find if I pull at my eyelashes too much they get red and sore, causing me to pick at them more. Getting a cold damp wash cloth and placing them on my eyes really helps distract the weird throbbing sensation I get on my eyelids if I donâ€™t pull. For leg hair etc, all I can recommend is trying to shave really well so thereâ€™s no ingrown hairs etc.  Iâ€™ve heard hypnotherapy or CBD (cognitive behavioural therapy) can help when you get in to situation where you want to pull hair, and help you refrain from doing it.  I think itâ€™s best to find out if thereâ€™s anything that triggers you pulling, like intrusive thoughts etc, and if itâ€™s something like mental health related, see a doctor. If itâ€™s just simply the satisfaction then maybe try methods like I suggested to help.   Hope that helps and if you have questions, Iâ€™m happy to answer â™¥ï¸\n",

Learning to do a really thick but pretty wing has made me the 'good eyeliner' girl in high school, not the girl with no eyelashes. I rarely wear eyelashes unless I am in a mood or there is a special occasion where I know lots of close-up pictures will be taken. Don't be pressured into feeling like you have to cover up your eyelashes - I'm always told that people rarely notice unless I point it out to them, especially when I'm wearing dark liquid eyeliner.\n",

I always get the brush on glue now, and apply it directly to my eyelid â€” some people feel really strongly about this, and definitely be careful when applying.   I WILL SAY the first time I put on fake eyelashes, it took me like 2 hours. Itâ€™s something that takes practice and wearing them daily takes a little while to get used to too (after a week you wonâ€™t notice them in your peripheral vision anymore) ... hope this helps!\n",

      "\n",
      "The eyelash adhesive that comes on the lashes is not sticky enough. I would suggest using Duo glue. I've been using for years when I am lashless. You add it to the base of the eyelashes, wait for it to get a bit tacky and then place on the lid. Gently. You can adjust them by pushing down to hold them in place until the glue dries fully. Nothing is going to last more than a day in my experience, so take them off nightly, remove the glue tidbits from the base and reuse them the next day. I've reused lashes for a week or so before needing a new set. Wearing them right up until bed can also help with pulling :)\n",

Two noticed and said not to worry, that lots of people came to them who had that and they knew how to work with it. (One of them even gave me a nice cream/gel thing that helped keep the shorter hairs from flying up).   Unfortunately, another one noticed it and had never seen it before. I had a lot of baby hairs growing back that were shorter than others and when he asked about it I just kind of brushed him off and gave a very vague explanation along the lines of â€œthat happens some times.â€ He then continued to not be able to take a hint and asked how it happened, and the conversation continued awkwardly until he finally dropped it. It was an extremely frustrating experience. However, English wasnt his first language and I think part of it stemmed from his confusion over my explanation.   So yeah, odds are in your favor that theyâ€™ll be understanding or not notice, and regardless theyâ€™re able to work with it. Still, be prepared for the scenario that they havenâ€™t seen it and are incredibly annoying about it.

      "Different hair grows at different speeds, and you're just going to need to accept that.   Trich is a type of OCD and is something that 9.99999/10 times you cannot help and you cannot stop, especially if she has been doing it her entire life. For people who don't experience it themselves, I try to compare it to nail biting. Most people know someone who is a biter, or who bites their own nails-- it's something you do without realizing, and it's something you do compulsively to the point of destroying your own nails. And then afterwords you stop and look at the damage you've caused and it affects you emotionally. \"Why did I do that? My nails look horrible. I'll do something about it tomorrow that will make me stop forever.\"  And maybe a fresh manicure does help and they do stop forever. Or maybe they continue on and regardless of what they try, it doesn't help.  I'm sure your friend has tried all you've been suggesting, and I'm sure your friend is saddened  about the state of her hair-- especially after 2 years of victory over OCD. If you want to be supportive, the best way is to not come with her with what you think are solutions; you need to ask her what you can do.

I just discovered what trich is today, and before that I thought touching my eyebrows as excessively as I do was not something other people dealt with because every time I expressed a concern about it to someone they just thought it was odd and just told me to stop doing it, as if that would help.  This is a relatively new problem to me; it started within the last 6 months. I am an extremely genuinely happy and optimistic person, however, I started my first year of law school this past fall and I think it started to become a habit while I was studying.  However, I am curious if this was brought on by stress. I think I deal with stress it really well, but I often get asked by my classmates how  and why I am able to spend 8 hours in the library and be smiling when I'm leaving. So, my \"hypothesis\" is that I am brushing my eyebrows so much to compensate for the amount of pressure school has put on my life.  Is that a fair assumption or is there some other reason why people form this habit?  Regardless, I am so thankful to see all of this positivity feel so much more at ease.  Thank you all!\n",

In the past two months, I got sick (maybe coronavirus, i don't know, it was all the symptoms though), my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, my father almost died from an infection, my boyfriend of 3.5 years broke up with me via text (my dumbass thought we were going to get married), I'm supposed to be finishing up my master's thesis in the next week and a half, I went to the hospital for an allergic reaction, and I had to call emergency services for a friend because her family thought she'd killed herself (she is ok, at least physically). I just can't deal. I need a break. How am I supposed to write my damn thesis with all this going on.

      "I think I can imagine. My mom was very much the same way when she first noticed my pulling. Not a single movement to help until I started improving, but she did notice and praise the improvement. She seems to have come around a little bit now, but I still flinch whenever she walks past me and she can look down at my scalp, even though it's much less noticeable now.  The best temporary solutions to curb pulling is to wear hats indoors or to occupy your hands as soon as you feel the urge, especially when you're around other people. Of course noticing it and taking action is the difficult part. It will take some time to train yourself and keep up to it, but I'd say if your family is detrimental to your progress you shouldn't give them any more ammunition. You might even find creating those habits will help you even when you're away from your family.  The only thing that should matter is you're doing what's best for YOU. It's so great you have both medication and therapy to help you. The next time they \"threaten\" to leave you alone you should respond with a calm yes every time.

      "I wear wigs when i work! My head has been shaved for a couple years now, and while wigs arent necessarily a part of my identity anymore, as a cashier i prefer not to have any conversations beyond \"do you need a bag\" so the more normal i look the better.  Theyre not too comfortable especially with all the irritated areas on my scalp, but the ones i wear now are miles ahead of what i started with (bless the internet). most of mine are styled in braids or ponytails that are (strategically)placed to stay on my head the best, so unless i feel fancy i dont use tape or glue. Ive found that no one really notices unless they themselves have experience with wigs, especially since mine are lace front and full lace.

Itâ€™s as if the whiskers are too thick.   Each one is like a sliver in my face I must remove.   Even when I donâ€™t pull for weeks thatâ€™s how each one feels.   No other hair feels like that and Iâ€™ve pulled everywhere for almost 30 years.   Whiskers are a whole new beast.    Chins are bad because the heat. Blood seems to rush to the area. Chin gets hotter. Pulling cools it off momentarily but of course makes it worse.   Iâ€™ve never had ice melt so fast as when switching to that to cool my chin after too many pulls.   Flavor savor is almost as bad.   Iâ€™ve been pulling places where I DO NOT WANT hair for 30 years. Still plenty of unwanted hairs there.   My beard hair replaces it self much faster than anywhere else.   Iâ€™ve had to shave my head several times due to bald spots and that can easily take 4 months before I can let it grow again.   If I pull out my mustache, fully.

      "I agree wholeheartedly with u/TrichyMinds. Cognitive behavioral therapy didn't help me much but I also didn't have enough time with it to see real results before my insurance changed and made it unaffordable. If it's financially accessible to you, I recommend exploring it. At the very least, it will not hurt.  I pluck mainly from my brows and lashes and sometimes my pubic region. Honestly, if it was just my pubic region, I'd personally probably not even bother with trying to stop myself, because no one sees it but my partner, and doesn't judge me for it (though it does make him sad overall because he knows it makes me sad). But because my brows and lashes are visible (and it's all gotten worse since starting school), I've resorted to other cessation tactics very recently.   Those are: 1) fake nails that are long enough to make it very cumbersome to try and pluck face hairs. That works well, but I've been known to finagle myself into pulling anyway... or getting some tweezers. (I generally use tweezers on my pubic region anyway.) So a few days ago I implemented a second strategy: 2) a reward system for not pulling.  I'm not sure why it's taken me so long to try a reward system, because I've successfully used it for sticking to weight loss plans. Basically, I made a rewards chart for no-pulling streaks milestones. I'm highly motivated by going out for dessert/dinner (and want it to be something special, especially since money is tight now), so for example, if I can go 7 days without pulling a hair, I'll treat myself to ice cream at my favorite local parlor. If I can draw that out to 14 days, then we'll get hibachi for dinner. 30 days, I get to buy myself a new book or game or whatever.  This requires me to have a bit of discipline because I have to self-police; my partner can gently swat my hands away from my face when we are together but that is a minority of the day. I have to be honest with myself and understand I'm not cheating anyone but myself if I pull out a hair and don't reset the \"Days Since\" app I've been using to keep track of my streaks. But I'm happy to report since implementing these two strategies simultaneously, I'm at 3 days, 8 hours, 51 minutes without any pulling! And counting!  Some people aren't reward-motivated, but I figured I'd share what I'm working on. Good luck.\n",

      "Hello, welcome to the community! I'm not great at advice but I'd recommend to keep trying until you find something that works personally for you (it may change overtime as well). It's a difficult thing but people seem to have different methods and ways of managing their Trich. I believe everyone's Trich is developed or \"intertwined\" differently in their lives, which makes it so hard to currently find one \"cure.\" But, I do have hope for managing it, through a mix of work, help, and/or possibly luck.  I'm currently going through professional help. It doesn't cure it, but it helps me personally by having an emotional/mental \"safety net.\" I have medication (Prozac for ocd/depression) if needed, which helps my resistance to picking, but most of it is still work. The therapy feels more like ways to cope with triggers, both in and out of Trich related things. I have stopped picking for long periods of time, and it did get easier overtime (but I did have a lot of setbacks). For me, I view Trich as more of a \"long term condition,\" instead of being \"wiped clean.\" This mentality mostly helps me because it keeps me cautious if I ever get tempted with \"just one hair.\"  It's my own opinion, but I would try it if you're in a good position to try it. Not everyone wants or has the ability to get professional help, and some are able to manage healthily without it. I believe I need it though because of my personality, and I just wanted additional help. Asking around and seeing other people's experiences are good too. Good luck, wishing you the best!\n",

I don't like having them go in and make comments like 'wow your layers are all over the place' and I've found that if I bring it up, they're less likely to make a big deal out of it.

Then she cut my hair in a way that hid my bald spot and simultaneously was the best hair cut I've ever had, even before pulling.  Additionally, my sister was talking to her hair stylist about my hair issues and her stylist said she styles people's hair all the time that have it and offered to help me with my hair for my wedding if I still needed someone to do it.

It sounds like to me your mother thrown you into situations back then that a child should have never have been thrown into. Why would she get mad at you for sleeping over at a friendâ€™s house? That isnâ€™t normal. You should have been allowed to have normal childhood fun.   You seem like a genuine person who really cares for others and that is a good thing. One thing I have learned is that you canâ€™t take care of others unless you take care of yourself first. Self care and self help is important. It isnâ€™t being selfish, itâ€™s just being sure not to neglect yourself. Everyone has needs. I know from experience that if I donâ€™t take care of my personal needs, my mental health suffers.  It sounds to me like your mom also has mental health issues, no offense. She may be a wonderful person in many ways but she should have never placed you in adult situations or made you feel guilty for having a sleepover as a child. That is gaslighting. She may not even realize she does it but I donâ€™t believe you are the only person in the house with mental health issues. She needs to own her own problems and acknowledge she needs help too.  Also, you should never feel guilty for seeking help for your health. That is called being responsible, which you seem to be.   Have you suggested taking a break from your mom? Like visiting a friend for a few days? If the animals are a concern, ask if you can take them with you. It is healthy for people to take a break from each other. It isnâ€™t selfish. People do it all the time. Think about it, for example, parents often go on vacation alone and leave the kids with someone else, to be alone, away from the kids. It doesnâ€™t mean they donâ€™t love them, it is just a healthy way to take a break from stress and achieve quality time as a couple.\n",

There's no option in which you'll feel no anxiety, even if they can't seen it you'll still be thinking about if they can see it or what they're thinking about you wearing a hat or cap or whatever. Part of it is just learning to cope with that constant baseline anxiety and learning to not GAF. I was terrified when I first told my first girlfriends and my close friends, but it's gotten a lot easier as a I've realized that although they'll never ever be able to understand that it's not a big a deal as I made it to be in my head.

I was *very* surprised by how understanding my family was. They didn't judge me at all. They actually help increase my awareness and they occasionally catch me absentmindedly pulling on my beard. It reminds me to smile, shrug it off, and bring my attention to something else. Just don't take it personally. They care about you.  Just remember that your Trichotillomania is not who you are. Don't determine your self worth based on your habits. Everyone has habits they want to change. The more we incorrectly expect others to stigmatize our mental illnesses and bad habits, the worse those habits tend to get. Just be you. â¤\n",

One week....or one day at a time.   I had to do this when I was cutting regularly. I had a sort of reward system that kept me honest. I had a small bracelet and each day I didnt cut, a small bead was added. After a week, the small beads were removed and replaced with one larger, special one. I took every day one by one.

But truthfully, there are too many reasons (it'll grow back, it's no-maintenance, i want my bald patches from trich to grow back with the rest of my hair, it looks damn CUTE, it helps destigmatize bald heads on women, i want to stop hiding behind my hair, etc. etc. etc.). And why does it matter? At the end of the day, you're the only one with your hair. And you can decide what to do about it. It's your life, your choices, your happiness. Good luck! :)\n",

      "Another long bearded...sorry recently trimmed former long bearded sufferer. My issue has only started quite recently. Up until mid February my beard was normal and full and long. Then it started with a combo of ADHD meds, stress and idle hands. Then in 2 weeks I had decimated the area of beard around my mouth by chewing away rough hairs. This completely thinned out the bottom area  and looked strange.   I tried tying it up but it was too late.  I had to severely trim it and now I no longer have a noteworthy beard. Since being diagnosed with ADHD last November it has been quite a rollercoaster.  If you can plait it or tie it up in a way that would avoid picking that would be my way of countering this, if I can grow it again.\n",

      "Another trich dude here with a beard.  I find that my pulling rotates from area to area throughout the years.  Sometimes I get fixated on a spot on my eyebrow and just can't stop if I get started.  I've recently been taking NAC supplement which has helped but that could be at least partially placebo.  One thing that has made a huge difference for me is microblading.  I had it done on my eyebrows and now when I pull there I don't freak out about it and get into a shame pulling spiral.  That has helped me avoid pulling from there altogether.  If you have a few spots in your beard where you pull you may want to look into microblading those spots which will have three benefits.  First is those areas will no longer be skin colored. They'll be the same color as your beard.  Second is that the process of having hundreds of tiny scabs in those spots from the little tattoo needle means that you can't pull from there for a week or ten days without fucking up the scabs.  I found that to be a nice forced break for me.  Third is that it costs money and takes effort and once you do it you may be less likely to pull from there because you know you invested in those spots.  Also, I have found that pulling my ear hairs can help scratch the itch that my brain sometimes needs when I am stressed and need a little dopamine squirt.  Lastly, I have made peace with the fact that I've got trich and it is annoying but it doesn't define me and it isn't my fault that certain hairs on my body itch like crazy.  When I meet people who ask about it I explain that it's like getting bitten by the most itch-inducing mosquito in the world.  Nobody can realistically not scratch that shit.    My own beard is pretty short and probably once every year or two I pick at a spot that becomes so glaringly obvious that I shave everything and then start over.  But between the NAC and trying to rotate my pulling to more socially acceptable places I've been to avoid that for quite a while now.\n",

      "Hey, its going to be okay.  We just have to keep telling ourselves that or else we'd all go mad.  Ive had trich for 5 years now and ive taken photos of my scalp from many different angles which would expose me to the horrors of pulling and traumatize me so much that it'd make me pull even more. It was a vicious cycle back then.  Wanna know what helped me? My bald spots arent as bad anymore, i actually have growth everywhere. So what helped? Having a support system. And tricks to get your hands busy.  I'm sure you've probably heard about the support system many times, but it really does work. I dont talk to anyone about my trich cuz obv its embarrassing and shameful, except of one person who actually cares and wants to be in the loop of how my hair is doing. My boyfriend has made talking about trich such a casual thing that i no longer break down when its brought up. That helps so much because it makes you feel like theres someone rooting for you. Even if you dont have that one person, then let us, or even me, be that person for you. We are here to help each other. We just want each other to get better because we all know how sucky trichotillomania is.  As for the tricks, the main one you need to know is the squishy animals i bought from amazon. I keep them everywhere around my room and even in my backpack so that if i start pulling, i take one out immediately and start playing with it. The whole hat and gloves thing? Forget about it. By \"blocking\" the pulling, you arent doing anything to actually satisfy your needs. The second u take ur hat off or gloves off, ull want to pull again. I think those methods suck. However with the squishy animals, ur letting ur brain destress and manage its anxiety by squishing the animals as an outlet. Kind of like stress balls! You are actually doing something to satisfy the need of pulling. You know the biggest thing that helps? If you make it a habit to play with those animals, even if you dont feel the need to pull, ull overall help ur brain destress before it reaches the maximum capacity where it starts to beg for pulling.   How do i know all this so well? I read a book about trich that gave a lot of strategy ideas on how to combat it. It was a childrens book but boy did it help me. Im 21, reading a kids book, but it frikin helped! The squishy animals is what made me control my hair pulling for 3 months straight!!!  But i ended up pulling again. Why? Because i got so confident rhat i thought i didnt need to play with a squishy animal again everyday. Unfortunately my stress built up since i no longer had that little outlet, and i pulled a lot. Thats why this, although its small, its hella mighty. Just try it at least. Let your brain relax while u play with the squishy animal. I, for example, only pull with my left hand for some reason. So i could play with the animal on my left while still do other stuff with my right. If you pull with both hands then grab two animals and give urself time to calm down and manage ur anxiety with a short session of just squishing these little animals.  I really hope this helps. Please let me know if it does. I really want to believe that this could help more than one person who is just me.

      "It sounds like a hybrid of trichotillomania and dermatillomania, but either way definitely a BFRB (body focused repetitive behavior). Personally, I try to avoid the word â€œhabitâ€ because these behaviors are not as easy to overcome as an ordinary bad habit. BFRBs are compulsive, and I would equate them to an addiction. Seeking therapy is going to be your best option, but if that is not available to you then there are a few things that you can try. Whenever possible, cover your scalp with a hat/bandana/scarf. Try wearing gloves when youâ€™re able, or silicone finger guards (generally for guitar finger picking). Find soothing scalp oils or creams (I like tea tree oil) to put on any spots that you seem to be focusing on. Buy a scalp brush or massager to use instead of your fingers. Try to find something that will keep both of your hands occupied (this could be putty, some sort of art project, a piece of textured fabric that you can run your fingers over, etc). For hair regrowth, try castor oil and leave it on overnight. For scabs, try Aquaphor if you can find it (similar to Vaseline). I hope that some of these suggestions are helpful to you, but please donâ€™t beat yourself up over it if they arenâ€™t. I cannot stress to you enough that this isnâ€™t just any ordinary habit.\n",

      "Sounds like a combination of trich and dermatillomania (compulsive skin picking). They're both closely related so the same therapist/medication/treatment plan should work for both. That said, get a therapist involved ASAP because the longer you do this, the more hardwired the habit becomes and the harder it is to fix. Good luck.\n",

      "Ditto to everything the previous commenter said. Itâ€™s different for all of us. I used to pull my eyelashes exclusively. Now I pull head hair and once in a while public hair. I also have some dermatillomania and cheek biting. I live in a small town and my therapist isnâ€™t any help with the trich, but she is familiar with it. Nobodyâ€™s going to report you for self harm unless youâ€™re suicidal, and it is nice to talk about it. Personally, I find the most help in talking to others with trich. There is still very little known about trich, but there are some things that have been found to help.\n",

      "Mod here - please take all medical advice (especially supplement doses) with a grain of salt. Questions about treatments like those are best answered by a pediatrician, preferably one with experience in OCD-related diagnoses. As for helping your daughter, remember that trich is often a symptom of a larger issue. It could be anxiety, misdirected emotional energy, improper 'grounding' for distraction, stunning, or just a fluke of genetics. Finding out the possible triggers of the trich will help you find mitigation tactics.   One trigger that is easy to overlook is not only negative stress, but positive stress as well. Fun events like going to a theme park or having a birthday party are still an emotional and physical stressor on the body, even if they are enjoyable. I am most likely to pull my eyelashes after either a significant negative event, or a big event like a convention or a theme park trip. Finding ways to redirect the reactions to stress can be key to controlling trich, assuming that is one of the triggers.   Also, for eyelashes specifically, keep an eye out for 'rebound picking'. I often will pull for a while, then feel guilty and stop, but have another pulling session sometime in the next 24 hours. The pain from distending the lid area due to pulling can mimic the sensation that triggers pulling (at least for me), so the pulling itself is a trigger for a second event. This is a great time to pull out distraction toys or other mitigation techniques.  Finally, your first instinct might be to call out the pulling when it happens, but this isn't the right technique for everyone. I had a roommate literally pull my hand out of my mouth once, and my reaction made sure it never happened again! My mother calling out my pulling always made me feel shameful and want to hide away to pull in secret. In contrast, my current roommate just reminds me that I am loved and that they are here for me, and that makes me want to stop far more than anything else. You may not be able to control the pulling, but you can control your reaction to it and your daughter. Come to the situation from a place of love (as I'm sure you do) and you will stay on the right path. :) Thank you for being an advocate for your daughter, and best wishes to your family!\n",

The shame one feels is so hard please try so hard to be mindful of not adding to that.  2. A counselor is so great and can be SOOO helpful! Try going to bfrb.org and seeing if there are any trich trained counselors in your area 3. NAC has shown to have the possibility (it has helped me as well) of reducing/stopping the pulling urges. The cons are that you have to take it twice a day, if you miss a day youâ€™re right back to pulling, you HAVE to be consistent, and for me at least once I stop I have a hard time starting again.

I guess hormones and stress pushed me to trich. I still have bad episodes, but I've come to terms with my trich. Its just a part of me now, and nobody cares that I don't have eyebrows or lashes. I know for me, the regrowth stage is the hardest. And my lashes, if there's a top lash that gets \"stuck\" on a lower lash, that is a huge trigger.

I don't think there was a defining event, maybe starting high school and being overwhelmed? But midway through I got critically ill and was given a death sentence so...yeah, that didn't help things for a 16 year old.   I used to pluck before bed at night. I've been plucking like a damn fiend this year. I pluck when I'm stressed or in pain and trying to distract myself. Then I end up sore and angry at myself.   It's been going on for...17 years now?

      "YMMV  Put on a nail polish you like. Make sure it sparkles and you love it, regardless of your gender. You are treating an issue, not trying to just have colorful nails.   Now, whenever you pick, hopefully it isnâ€™t a mindless activity you can zone out to, but you are now destroying the manicure that you can see. This is a lot more visual and tactile than the hard to visualize scalp. I discovered this trick with a deep green (fav color) and was crushed when I broke the polish. This trick especially works when the polish is soft, as any picking will crinkle the surface of the polish, ruining it.  Also! Shampoo with Salycilic Acid (One of Neutrogenaâ€™s T/Sal has it. Not all of them, just one). Let the shampoo sit on your head for at least five minutes before washing it out. This reduces inflammation and will help with any scabs/pain/redness\n",

      "Hi, I think understand what you're going through. I've been picking my face, shoulders, decolte and back for years and have many scars but recently I found the following very helpful and can actually see some improvement, especially on my back and face. I'll share my tips and hope you find some of it useful.   (1) decided on a skincare routine and apply all of the cleansers and serums to my back and shoulders, not just my face. I try to keep my skin hidrated and help it heal.   (2) started wearing a long sleeve turtleneck shirt every day. Yes, even in the hot temperatures we're having right now. This makes it difficult for me to reach my shoulders and back and after three weeks they're visibly starting to heal.   (3) to occupy my hands that would usually be picking I squish some clever putty or hold a very smooth rock I keep on my desk. I like the feeling and I found it keeps my hands from going over affected areas.   (4) installed the 'I'm sober' app and make myself reset the \"pledge\" every time I pick even the tiniest scab. This helped me raise awareness on how often my hands really go searching for any imperfections to pick.   Also, until recently I had a sort of a mental imperative to _never pick again otherwise I'm a worthless piece of shit_. I'm really trying to grow past that mentality and learn that relapses are a normal part of progress, and that no matter how hard I decide today I can't magically stop tomorrow, but I _can_ continue fighting it. One urge at the time. I know you can do it too. Good luck!\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm sort of the same way. Not only do I try to clean fibers, but I'm a very bothered person when it comes to scabs. if my fingertips are scabbing up (and the finger isn't \"clean\" from the uneven layers of skin) I have to pick. I guess my type of picking is both visual and touch (I hate seeing the uneven skin, and I HATE *feeling* the uneven skin if my fingertips touch each other (which is all the time).  &#x200B;  My only ways to help is just (at least in my case) to moisturize frequently (so scabs don't catch on fabric and stick out like a sore thumb), and to make myself makeshift bandages (if band aids aren't available) with tape and a disposable cloth (toilet paper works). Not the best way to fix my problem, but not having to constantly \"feel\" and \"see\" the imperfection gets rid of the urge to pick. You can always clean up the actual wound with peroxide if available, but soap and water works as well. I know you just said that soap doesn't exactly fix your intrusive thoughts, but try to cover it. Go 10 mins before \"cleaning it\" again by covering. Keep extending that time until you feel like you won't have to worry about the wound being \"dirty\" if it's covered. I just excuse myself to the bathroom and cover up the fucked up fingertips with any bandages I keep on me from home, or make them. Not exactly pretty, but gets the job done.  &#x200B;  Stay safe!!!

      "I'm gonna guess you're talking about your head hair bc I deal with the same thing.

I think I might have naturally curly hair, but just messed up my hair for so long that I thought it was meant to be straight.  Anyway, my absolute go-to trich trick (heh, see what I did there?) Is braiding my hair at night after I take a shower. This way when I do my hair in the morning the short curly hairs somewhat blend in with the rest of my hair. I use Aussie sprunch spray to keep my longer hair wavy/curly from the braids, then I use Aussie instant freeze hair spray to pin down those little bits that are just growing in (and constantly stick up bc they arent long enough to be straightened yet). I make sure all of my hairs stay in their exact spot by using that instant freeze spray and a fine tooth bomb. Also colored hair spray. Always have colored hair spray.  Overall, your best bet is to just get used to curly hair for now. When you get to a point where the baby hairs are long enough to straighten, you can straighten all of it on a regular basis, which will damage it enough to stay relatively straight. That being said, if you pull and new hairs grow in, you'll have to start the whole thing over again.   But it is honestly not that bad and you just get used to conforming to various hairstyles. I have a lot more tips that I've learned by myself over the years if you're interested. I really hope this helped â¤\n",

      "So I only pull my eyelashes and eyebrows, pretty severely too, since I was 9 (am 30  now). The last 5 years I've been able to gain some more control and I've been able to grow out my lashes completely on multiple occasions, and most of my brows on few occasions. So far, my lashes grow in correctly, but I've noticed that most of my brows grow in curly, making them look very ill-managed, and they end up drawing my attention to them. Anyways, I let them grow and kept them however they grew in for a  few months until I relapsed. The next time they grew in they were slightly straighter, but still horribly bent. Each time they grew in, they became a little more straighter.     Basically, Allowing them to grow and stay for a while probably helps to heal the damaged follicle. That's my only guess.\n",

I need to get in the habit of throwing it in a trash can. I hate hate HATE loose hairs laying around, and it makes it difficult to bring myself to clean areas where I pull because I find touching the hairs disgusting.

      "I've done this for years now. I started pulling pubic hair because I felt like it would be less noticable and I could hide it.

Now I have a big patchy bald spot right on the mons pubis and I feel so incredibly self conscious about it. It's scraggly, uneven and it won't grow back. I felt I had to shave every time before sex because I was too ashamed of my disorder and embarrassed of how I made my pubic area look.  My advice: pulling pubic hair created a distraction for me so that my eyelashes could start to grow in. But it really just turned into a new problem area. I started to try pulling only hairs around the bikini line, and that's worked well so far. I do clean the area with rubbing alcohol before and after pulling to help prevent infection.  Don't do it. It doesn't wrangle the urge like we hope it will, it just adds fuel to compulsion fire.\n",

I switched to pubic hair from head hair when puberty hit, and it's been a monster to control ever since. It's almost more enticing because with it being a more private area, you feel like the consequences aren't as severe. But it personally made me incredibly self conscious about being intimate with partners and has left a lot of scarring/discoloration on the more sensitive skin. And it can also make certain clothes harder to wear- cute underwear rubs in a pretty unpleasant way if I let it get out of hand. After so many years of doing it, Im finally looking into laser to reduce hair and help with scarring\n",

I've pulled eyelashes since I was about 8, and then I think around 13 I started doing eyebrows too, and then sometime later...maybe 17...pubes and occasionally forearm hair and then at around 27 I also started pulling leg hair. I'd say in terms of risking infection, ingrown hair and scarring legs is worst, pubes second worse. I've never really had ingrown from lashes, eyebrows or arm hair although arms/eyebrows occasionally get a bit infected.  Pubes is definitely easiest to hide although when I was single it sucked because I like having a landing strip and I'd screw it up and have to go Brazilian...not the worst, just not my first choice.

      "Welcome, glad you found us (even though this disorder sucks and seems almost impossible to treat at times).   I have trouble with pulling, especially at night/in private too, so I would def echo the other comment re: scarves/bandanas/other coverings. For years I wore various colored bandanas as â€œheadbandsâ€ during the dayâ€”really they were there to prohibit pulling and make me conscious of itâ€”and wearing wraps and scarves at night that made it almost impossible to pull without disrupting the head covering and, as such, sometimes, becoming aware and choosing not to do so (when my brain allowed). Definitely didnâ€™t work all the time for me, but itâ€™s helped me become more conscious of my habits and when my pulling â€œtrancesâ€ happen.   Good luck to you; these types of behaviors are so hard to deal with, especially since they can have noticeable physical effects. Iâ€™ve seen people have success with wigs, never been a great option for me but maybe they can help disguise any bald patches while you treat the underlying impulses.

      "For me, it usually is a single eyelash or eyebrow hair. If I am proactive, I can use tweezers to find the offending hair and remove it.

      "I know exactly how you feel. :( It's so hard to deal with the nagging pain that says \"pull me and you'll feel better!\" The problem is, you might get the \"right\" eyelash, but the action of pulling irritates the eyelid, so you still won't get any relief. It's hard, but try to resist.   Try a warm compress over your eye to relieve any pain/moisten the area. Some trichsters use oil to make the lashes too slick to pull, although I can't vouch for its efficacy or safety. Flooding your eye with saline (aka contact solution) can help with the irritation, especially if there is a real source of pain under the eyelid. Avoid wearing mascara, contacts, or anything else that would give you reason to touch your eyelid.   (Also, not to scare you, but touching your eyes is one way that diseases like coronavirus make their way into the body.)  Remember, no matter what happens, you are still lovable. We all fail from time to time, but you are still fighting and trying to do what's best for your body.

For a lot of people, identifying the trigger is the biggest first step. A lot of times it's 'stress', but tracking can help you further identify and overall make you more mindful and aware of your pulling. 2. Do something that will physically stop or slow your pulling. I've started wearing hats and bulky headphones that get in the way of my hair. I also have started getting my nails done; I physically cannot pull at my hair this way.  Good luck on your journey!\n",

      "I do the same thing, but for me it's an underlying unhealthy level of perfectionism that drives my pulling behavior. When I pull, I end up systematically targeting the wiry, scraggly, coarse hairs and any white hairs (basically, those from follicles damaged previously by pulling). It makes me feel better because I have removed the imperfect hairs. 9/10 times it's because I am worrying over being imperfect in some way, whether it's physically or more often academically or professionally. 1/10 times it's because I am ignoring that I am hungry and should stop whatever I am doing and go eat.  I am working toward overcoming my unhealthy perfectionism (thanks, mom) now that I know this is the cause of my trich and previous habits of nail biting (getting braces helped cure this for me because I couldn't do it for 2 years), lip picking (still working on this, but trich is my top priority to overcome), etc (I've had every single non-ingesting behavior at some point in my life).\n",

      "I'm responding to your final question in your post.  If you pull your hair when you perceive one as \"bad\" and you find that satisfying ... you definitely have trich. It's the dictionary definition.  When you pull in that way it may also satisfy another underlying psychological/physical need, but it doesn't mean that you do not have trich.  Of course the question really is how you should feel about having trich.  If you do it infrequently and the consequences of pulling don't bother you then it doesn't matter much that you have trich.  But if you get frustrated, angry, self-critical about your pulling then you may find it helpful to try things to address the issue.  I have been struggling with it for many years but it doesn't define me.\n",

      "So regardless of whether or not you have autism, we know that pulling is \"automatic/sensory\" on the four functions of behavior. Its reinforcing properties come from the behavior itself.   Does that mean you have autism? No idea. But the punishing aspects of pulling (negative social attention, negative self image) are not enough to overpower the reinforcing or, maintaining aspects (automatic/sensory, negative reinforcement [escape from \"needing\" to pull])   So you can put a label on it, but the behavior itself is the one that needs to be changed, not YOU as a whole person or changing the label.

The ones I remember are duloxetine, paroxetine, Effexor, Fluoxetine, Escitalopram, N-Acetyl Cystine, propranolol, abilify (ariripiprazole), Zoloft, and Wellbutrin (buproprion). Most of them did nothing for me or even made my symptoms worse! However, I have had great success on Abilify 2mg. My mood is improved and Iâ€™ve only pulled twice in the past month, and I actually have nails now! I used to pull everyday. I am also on Wellbutrin 150 mg which really helps with depression and anxiety. Also, whenever I do catch myself pulling I take .5 mg of Xanax and it makes me so relaxed I donâ€™t even have the urge to do anything, even compulsive pulling. Doctors are reluctant to prescribe Xanax now though. Hope this helped!  If SSRIs donâ€™t work for you I would suggest an SNRI\n",

The best things that helped me were staying busy, wearing out my body during the day, having something else to play with besides my hair, wearing my hair up, and I still pull but in a very controlled way. Basically, whenever i tweeze my eyebrows etc. I allow myself to only pull for grooming purposes. Therapy also helped me a lot with DBT and CBT techniques. I hope this is useful for you.

Communication with your doctor is important - either contact them by phone or email, or schedule an appointment to discuss your side effects. As others have mentioned, different SSRI's work in various ways for different people, so another SSRI may give you the benefits without the pulling.  In the meantime, try using some common coping techniques to help you through those pull sessions: deep breaths, redirecting the energy onto something else (pulling apart felt, snapping a rubber band, using a fidget toy), going for a brief walk/exercise, confiding in a friend.

You might also benefit from finding a local support group and/or a doctor/therapist near you who has experience with trich.  Another thing that helps me is keeping a notepad in my pocket and writing down every time I pull.  The point of this is NOT to stop you from pulling.  That shit is often overwhelming.  Rather, the point of it is to make a deal with yourself that each time you pull you will write down what you were doing, what you were feeling, what you have eaten, when you last exercised, etc.  There's no excuse for not doing that.  Just gather the data and then you can analyze it and look for trends.  Also, I've had some success with the Pavlok shock bracelet and also with NAC (the supplement) taken along with a multi-vitamin.  Lastly, I'll say that if you are going to be pulling your hair out for much of your life, you will benefit from not beating yourself up over it.   To put a radical though out there, why do you care that you pull?  Other than the cosmetics of it, who cares?  How does it hurt you?  If you lived in a world where everyone did the same thing you'd feel and be completely normal.  So is it the bald spot that bothers you?  If so, maybe look into microblading, which is semi-permanent tattoos.  I had that done on my eyebrows and it changed my life.\n",

Putting the mirrors in my room somewhere else, I had two before, one big and one small, it'll still be difficult to avoid mirrors completely but the temptation to pick is even worse when you're alone in your room.   . Having a though journal, when you want to pick just grab a pen and write whatever comes to you mindfully, it can just be \"I feel down\", \"I want to pick\" or \"I tried a new mask I feel better\". It will help you to notice why you want to pick and keep your mind busy.   . Have something to keep your hands busy if you have the habit to pick unconsciously, like playdoh, a soft ball, slim or something like that so you don't touch your skin.   . Take a picture of your skin after picking to much to remind yourself of the damage you've done, so when you feel the urge to do it again, look at the photos and tell yourself that you're not doing it again because you have the consequence right under your eyes. You can do the opposite too, take a photo of your good days to remind you how you'll be if you don't pick.   I hope that you'll find what works the best for you, don't give up\n",

      "I have a meditation technique I use... While laying on my back in a comfortable sleeping position, pay attention to the patterns you see in the back of your eyelids (you know, those moving colors). Now, keeping focus on those patterns, start counting slow, rhythmic breathing... With each (relaxed) breath in, hold for a few moments and release, add 1 to your count. If you lost count, just make up a number or start over and keep going (the number is not important, doing the math is what helps), but keep focusing on those patterns you see.  Here's why this works: by focusing on the patterns in the back of your eyes, you're engaging the visual processing center of your brain, which is connected to your short term memory centers. The process of doing the math in your head uses a separate part of your brain which competes for those processing centers. In doing both at the same time, you're helping your brain clear out unprocessed information, and you're diverting resources normally used by your brain for other things related to your waking mind (like attention and focus) to the parts of your brain that are important in regulating sleep and converting short term memory into long term memory. You're basically overriding your conscious thought process by forcing it to activate different processing centers. Since your brain is really only good at processing one or two things at the same time, by trying to focus on what you're imagining you're seeing, and doing (simple) imaginary math, it frees up the rest of your brain to do what it needs to do to enter rest mode.  Sometimes instead of using the patterns I see, I'll listen to guided meditation, and try to use my imagination. Instead of counting numbers, I'll do abc's in my head forward and backwards. Again, the important thing here is giving my brain something to do that ISN'T processing daily information or memory. Not thinking about things, but entering a relaxed, repetitive pattern. It's basically like counting sheep, but not as cliche.\n",

Iâ€™m so glad you feel like you have a weight off your chest, and even though I know how hard it is, I hope this encourages you to open up more to people in your life that care about you! And youâ€™re definitely not alone! I actually think my trich started out in a similar way. I used to have long hair and when I would wear it pulled back in a ponytail, I would play with the little loops and bumps that were in my hair. Like if it wasnâ€™t perfectly smooth, Iâ€™d twist the hair around and tuck it in. It got to the point where it would get super knotted. My mom used to get annoyed with me because of how often Iâ€™d do it lol. Now I have short hair, and not enough to twist it around, but you definitely arenâ€™t an anomaly. Trich is so strange! Like why in the world do our brains tell us to do these things?! But on the plus side, in the trich community, youâ€™re never alone in what youâ€™re experiencing, and no one will judge you for it. I can also relate to your experience in a couple other ways. Iâ€™ve worn a hat every day for the last couple years since my trich is so bad, and I started seeing a new therapist and she immediately requested that I take my hat off so she could see. I just started crying so hard. Thereâ€™s sooo much shame that comes with trich, and I know how exposed you can feel even thinking about it. Iâ€™ve also had times where Iâ€™m late to work or class because Iâ€™m sitting at home, pulling my hair out. Itâ€™s so frustrating. I know youâ€™re not looking for advice, but there are therapists who specialize in trich! There might be some around your area! Anyways, I believe in you, man. Youâ€™re not alone!\n",

      "Hey buddy.  You're nowhere near alone!  I highly recommend that you read some of the books written about trich.  When I picked them up I was stunned to see that huge numbers of people were doing things that I thought were unique to me.    Trich is a very chemical thing.  Doing certain things soothes us and makes us feel good.  This happens with tons of animals.  Golden Retrievers often get fixated on a spot in their fur and bite it out until they make themselves bleed.  Why?  Because it feels good.  It is not your fault that you are wired this way.  I know you are not looking for advice but in my experience talking about it with your significant other can be a HUGE load off your mind.  I used to be constantly worried about people finding out and judging me.  When I had kids I told them about it early as something that I struggle with and for their whole lives they have known and whenever they have something they struggle with that is biological or chemical in nature we have that in common.  I told my wife all about my trich and asked her to help me as I put myself through CBT / HRT  as I read one of the popular workbooks.  I identified some of my triggers and she helps me avoid them.  Or at least she did until she seemed to forget and now it is a non-issue for her.  :)  If your girlfriend likes to research things I bet she would love to read any of the books about trich, with you, and support you.

I'm not super open about it, but am able to discuss it with out feeling shame or guilt at this point.  Getting to this point was basically attending the annual conference. Seeing a therapist. Work through all previous underlying issues. Then tackling trich.   I'd say it took me about 4-6 years from first conference to finally being ok with trich.

When Iâ€™m reading/concentrating Iâ€™ll play with my hair and the pain of the pull helps me refocus.   Strategies I use when I donâ€™t want to pull:   -Fidget jewellery. I wear rings I can spin around, and some that have sharp corners, so I can stab the corner of it into my finger if Iâ€™m feeling the urge to pull.  - Barriers. Gloves, tape on fingers (I pull with my fingers too), I put Vaseline all over the areas I regularly pull (only do this at home) it looks silly but whenever I touch the goop it reminds me to stop.   -Breathing techniques. At work, bc of covid, I have to wear a mask, face shield and gloves. I nearly went mad with all the barriers preventing me from pulling. I felt like my eyebrows were on fire and they itched so terribly. I just kept reminding myself that the urge will pass. Deep breathes- breath in for 4 seconds, hold for 7, breath out for 8. Repeat. It helps to settle the urge and refocus without pulling.\n",

The first part of the interview is simply a yes/no endorsement of  exposure to a series of potentially traumatic events.  eg. Natural Disasters  \"Have  you directly experienced a natural disaster/have you witnessed it/have  you learned about it from a friend or family\" and you endorse yes or no  to these items.  Following this, I  will be asking how your experience of a potentially traumatic event has  impacted your day to day functioning (e.g., work, home life) and will  assess some of your reactions and emotional responses as well.  E.g. \"In the past month, have you had any unwanted memories of (EVENT) while you were awake, so not counting dreams?\"  The  level of disclosure regarding details of your trauma exposure is to the  extent to which you are comfortable, noting that the questions are  focused on level of subjective disturbance and distress. The time taken  to complete the assessment is only a rough estimate of how long it might  take depending on the detail of responses.  Please note that as participation is completely voluntary, you can withdraw from the study at any time.\n",

      "I mean, Reddit isnâ€™t a good place to go for advice on medical treatment.   Personally, I may do this on my own. I actually think it would be good for me to write it out in plain English, clearly and concisely so I cant deny it and I can maybe make some connections to current behaviors.   For me, after writing it out, Iâ€™d either put away safe somewhere or dispose of it. I donâ€™t see any value in re-reading it after over and over but I do think Iâ€™d benefit from a clear, logical timeline.   However, Iâ€™m not a mental health professional, I donâ€™t personally use therapy for my trauma issues (I have a therapist but not for trauma stuff). So YYMV.   It can help in therapy to have clear, actionable goals. â€œConfronting traumaâ€ is actually a vague concept. For example, one goal with my therapist that I made was fewer panic attacks/ binge eating. That is a concrete, measurable goal as opposed to â€œimprove my relationship with myself and my past abuse and relationship with foodâ€ which is kinda vague in practice.   So maybe talk to your therapist about your goals with therapy and how she thinks the trauma map will get you closer to your goals.\n",

Iâ€™m sorry youâ€™re going through this, and Iâ€™m sorry your feeling hesitant about sharing openly and honestly about it.  I think a lot of response has to do with state rules. I can only to speak to CA, since that is where i live and perform these type of assessments.   First, i would ask your doctor what their confidentiality statement is. Mine is something like, â€œif you tell me something that lets me know that you or someone else will be hurt, then I will likely need to tell someone else to make sure everyone is safe.â€ When a client discloses suicidal ideation, we usually talk through it. My goal is to determine if a person has a plan, a means to access that plan, and intention to follow through with that plan. If those three conditions arenâ€™t met, weâ€™ll create a safety plan - what will you do if these thoughts happen again? Who can you call or what can you do to keep you safe? Can you commit to staying safe? I have only ever called authorities if a client tells me â€œi cannot keep myself safe. I cannot commit to safety. I plan to kill myself.â€ At this point, itâ€™s usually a joint decision to call someone else to support them.  Your therapist and doctor are on your side. If you donâ€™t feel comfortable sharing something like this with them, it might be worth looking for someone else?   Regardless, I hope you find peace, and this isnâ€™t an issue in your life anymore. If it is, thatâ€™s okay too. Please reach out to your network for support and love!\n",

If you can, reach out to others, sometimes just having some company was helpful. Remember, you will get through this.

The way the world operates on a grand scale you'd think everyone would be a big jerk, but instead most of us are just kinda jerks, and even then there's still people that are unfathomably good and help a lot.

They can't do anything about you asking, but if your thoughts are getting out of control, you do need to seek a solution. A hospital stay is for your safety so you have time to let those thoughts pass in a safe environment. I can 100% understand why you'd be against that, but if it's something you want to avoid you'll have to be proactive. If you think that the thoughts you're having will lead you to an involuntary stay, you can try researching or speaking with your psychiatrist about options that way you'll have the comfort of choice. But I'd definitely ask and try to be as honest as possible.   I would THINK if you didn't have an active plan or weren't distressed beyond reason then you should have full control over the situation, but as I said ask. And if you do have an active plan, or feel at your absolute worst, maybe you shouldn't necessarily worry about the outcome as long as it means you're still alive.

Your character--, it's going to be hard to keep your positive attributes like love and trust after this, but that's only if you tie it to him. Those are YOUR positives. Someone took advantage of your positive traits, and that sucks, but it can only harm you more if you let it.   But as I said. That sucks. Mourn. Cry. Just not too long. You've got a whole new year just for you. The truth hurts sometimes, but lies hurt more, and it's better you found out than lived with ignorant bliss.   I honestly think you should distance yourself from the situation if it's a threat to your mental health, and maybe be preemptive in seeking help if you think it's necessary. You're freshly hurt, and there's nothing wrong with just focusing on the essentials for yourself.   If it doesn't hurt your character, it can't harm you.

What made you feel better before? It's great you're pursuing something for yourself. If you retrace your footsteps maybe you'll find something that helped. Truth is, you're taking up something that will be tiring and challenging, but rewarding. Focusing on the reward might elevate your spirits, but maybe you need a balance too. A way to treat yourself, or relax. You could start a new book, or series, take up a new hobby. You can try to meet like-minded people.  First you have to really figure out what's bugging you though. I'd suggest using your support when you can. If you prefer more privacy, therapy could be an option. It sounds like you've been doing amazing, so don't sell yourself short for feeling badly. Just try to remember why you felt good.\n",

      "Well, the first step has probably gotta be getting ahead of the alcohol. Seems like it would be one less thing to worry about. Sure, maybe you could find moderation, but is it worth the risk with so much on your plate? You've got a breakup to process which sucks, but once you process it healthily then you'll feel a lot better. And then you have your sexuality to explore, which could be very exciting for you once you dont have the other things to worry about. 28 is still the first third of life. This will all be a distant memory soon enough, and maybe a fond one depending on how you take things from here.   Therapy and/or AA could be a great idea. Therapy is confidential, and you can say as much or as little as you want to. I've never been to AA, but it could be a nice alternative. There's nothing wrong with seeking to improve, when so many people don't.  You still have some passion in you, self-awareness, will... Invest it all in yourself and ask how you could make tomorrow better than today. N\n",

      "This sounds like me, and you're not alone - a lot of people feel like that. It's part of some people's emotional mindset as default, unfortunately. A lot of us will never love ourselves but it is entirely possible to be content with ourselves. For me, I look at what I like in myself.

      "If you hate yourself, then it means you at least care. I mean you're asking how to work on it, and that's great. I think you should get real first. What do you like about yourself. Take a full hour, or day, or week, or however long and think about. Write it down. You know what I like about you? You're having a hard and you reached out. You're being brave by asking strangers. And you're not only willing to improve, you're actively seeking it. So that's 3 good things about you already. When you figure out everything you legitimately like about yourself, make sure you keep that. That's your character.   I don't think you hate yourself. You probably just dislike certain things. I'm disorganized by nature, sensitive, and tend to keep myself down. So I reformed my habits into cleaning daily. (I have an off week here and there) I practiced philosophy, specifically Stoicism which really taught me how to handle my emotions better. And when I'm down, I try to remember I can still make things at least a little better by trying to keep my chin up.   So take the things you dislike and figure out how you can improve. It's important to be yourself though. Take your character, and improve upon it. Don't compare yourself to others, just to the you from a moment before, and try to be better than that.   Find things that make you feel good about yourself. I enjoy writing, poetry, positive music, projects, getting my hair done, a facial mask, and feeling helpful. Do things that make you feel good without overindulging. Reward and pamper yourself, turn it into Productivity and will power, rinse, wash, repeat.   You can do it! And if you can't, you can try. And if you try, you're already one step closer to succeeding.\n",

It opened up a lot of time to just focus on me, and really get rid of the fluff in life until I figured out exactly what I cared to do again. In any case, as I said, super relatable.

      "The ancient Greek emperor Marcus believed that death shouldn't be feared. In fact, it should be accepted cheerfully. Many stoics like Marcus would share that sentiment. Of course, if you rushed to your death from sadness or dissatisfaction, that wouldn't be accepting death cheerfully. Death is simply a part of nature. If you're religious, then there's a million reasons not to die purposely. But Stoics valued the mind. All you are is your mind, and you can be king of that domain. Dying would mean the end of all function. The logical mind would accept that day will come, but wouldn't yearn for it. The real question isn't why fear death, but why love life. And there's nothing wrong with sticking around long enough to find out, because everyone dies, but not everybody lives.   Wanting to die is against the nature of every living and concioius thing. Now, that's not to say I don't relate, but truly there will be plenty of time to be dead. Why waste decades of rare time, when you could waste even half your life to learn to love the other half?  Death should be of indifference. Neither despised or loved. It simply is. Just a force of nature. Life is the only variable. So many things you can do with it, it'd be a shame to leave such a short potential delight for the infinite abyss. There will always be time for infinity.\n",

Maybe just go a bit easier on yourself. What if tomorrow you just try to be a bit better than today? Like, you could floss. Or if you already do that and your dentist doesn't have to remind you every time, then you could maybe... Put a quarter in someone's meter.

      "Boy do I know that feeling. It kind of sucks. Like some kind of sick obligation. But hey, you should be grateful. It makes the first step a lot easier. I wrote my suicide notes and fucked up just to be reminded that I had those obligations. It feels like you're free falling while hooks drag you back up. You know what I did? I just accepted it. I accepted that suicide just passes the pain onto someone else. The fact I had so many people to worry about meant there could've been a version of me that had no one to worry about. So I accepted it. I even crunched the numbers once on how long I'd have to live before being just HALF as obligated as I was. Even then, it was so much time, I figured I had time to kill before even thinking about killing myself.   So you're hurting people? Maybe. Because they're worried? If that's the case then you're not just obligated to stick around but improve, at whatever pace. People will be sad when you're gone. And that just means your life means something not only to you, but others. And that's a beautiful thing in a world where so many people carry selfish ideals.   So, how will you spend your time? Therapy? I personally have found great joy in philosophy, ad I'm hoping to start some new projects and hobbies this year. I'm just grateful that I had enough reasons to stick around. I'm still sad, but it forced me to find a different path. Whenever I'm really down I remember what I've put everyone through. How much they care. How much I care for them, even when I don't care too much for myself. I wish I knew what the future holds, but once you accept that you'll live... Well, I sleep better knowing that I'm not a threat to myself.   So, think about what you can do for the people you love, and how it'll make you feel making them feel good. That's a decent place to start, and truthfully, they'd probably be happy to see you happier. I think you could start there.   I'd recommend reading meditations.

Sounds to me like you really put yourself out there, and it sucks things didn't go as expected. I've been practicing philosophy, specifically stoicism, and I think you might enjoy a dabble. I started with Meditations. I won't bore you with all the details, but something mentioned in the book is how if something doesn't harm your character, how can it hurt you. Well, it sounds like your character was a bit damaged, but that's not the point. You're still the kind of person that put themselves out their in the first place. Remember who you were before you were hurt. Anyone that tried to harm you is only harming themselves. And if they can look in the mirror and not see that, pity their ignorance.   Not everyone is horrible. Everyone is flawed. That's true. You've gotta focus on you for a bit. And that's not a stab, it's just that if you tried to harm yourself, you're the closest enemy, and we can't have that. I've been there, and it took a lot of hard work and decisions to stop being the guy that's out to get me. I'm still working on it.  I've been to a few therapists and I've only ever liked 2 out of a whole lot. It worked then. But philosophy is my depressions Kryptonite. In any case, I think you need to find your kryptonite. It's too early in the year of give up. You're still in the fight.  There are a lot of great people out there. You'll get to know some. Figure out what your true character is, what you want it to be, and then be unwavering. If that character can't be harmed, neither can you.\n",

      "(M26) Itâ€™s been 15 days and no one has replied so I will shoot my shot. 1st off I hope 15 days later you are doing better and this is somewhat behind you.    I know how it feels to lose your high school sweet heart. In 7th grade I started dating the then love of my life. I too had stolen her from another guy. Following that we were inseparable until after high school were she and I both became unfaithful. Afterwards we made various attempts to make it work. The longer you allow toxicity to dwell in the heart of your relationships the more difficult it is to remove. Ultimately after nine years the pain for me was to deep and we separated.    You must be around 21 years old. Donâ€™t beat yourself up about your situation learn from it. I can guarantee there are more fish in the sea. I would start by reconnecting with your friends and family. Then start cutting ties with people you donâ€™t trust, (especially those you are sexually involved with) who lie to your face. I am not only talking about your ex, this pertains to anyone past, present or future you bring into your life. This may hurt but if you continue to invest in people who donâ€™t have your best interest at heart the excruciating pain of disappointment after disappointment will be met with more pain or even worse.    However, Youâ€™re a free man! Take the time to do some self-improvement, connect with some new people and enjoy the college life. Donâ€™t go running into another relationship or back to your ex (have a little self respect) start making intimate long lasting connections. Travel, learn more about yourself and how you effect the world around you. Most important when making new connections be upfront and honest about your expectations.    Recently while traveling to New York (My ex hated traveling) I ran into my latest connections in Central Park. I was honest about my intentions she gave me her number and we had a great time exploring together. She was far better then many previously girls Iâ€™ve connected with and we are still friends today. The best part is now the next time I go to NYC I may have a place to stay. If I had still been held down by my previous toxic relationship I wouldnâ€™t have ever been able to experience New York and so much more.   Lastly you are a free man so Iâ€™ll leave you with this, remember to keep your standards high, donâ€™t settle for less than what your worth, have fun and enjoy the presents of life. You will have plenty of time to meet the next girl of your dreams later on in life. When it is meant to be it will happen one way or another and when it does it will be better then anything you ever expected. Life will give you signs if your on the right track, those signs are good fortune, joy, and success you just have to be open to receive them.   This to shall pass.\n",

      "I think the first thing to do here is understand this will not be an immediate fix. Whether itâ€™s sleep, drug/alcohol use, or a big environmental change, it is unrealistic to expect this to disappear overnight. I canâ€™t tell if this is some sort of paranoia issue (remember that paranoia is not just thinking someone is watching you). If I were you I would strongly consider medication. For all we know, you might only need it for a few months. I understand the whole dependency concern as I hear a lot of people with mental health complications mention that. But, it is not about dependency. Itâ€™s about brain chemistry. Whateverâ€˜s going on here IS something in your brain. Anyone who can prescribe you medication for something like this knows what they are doing, so it is likely that after trying a few medications you will see a significant improvement.

This is something I've been dealing with ever since (I say 'ever since' like it's been a while, in reality I've only not picked in like 6 days, lol) I stopped picking. What I've started doing at the same time is using a cheap cuticle oil 'pen' (brush) from Amazon like 6+ times a day, especially after washing my hands.  Gently rubbing it in turns the urging feeling of an itch into a duller sensation. It's still very much there and hard to ignore BUT it seems to offer just enough reprieve to resist picking and let myself focus on something else.\n",

Any post or comment made that doesn't follow rules and guidelines must be addressed/removed or discussed with a more senior mod/admin, regardless of popularity. 3.  I have been struggling with dermatillomania since the age of 13, with worsening periods throughout the years (I am now 31). Even with having bipolar rapid cycling, generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD, as well as physical conditions, dermatillomania is still, somehow, the most misunderstood and stigmatized condition I have. My special needs son has also strongly struggled with trichotillomania, to a point of needing to shave his head for nearly two years because of the severity. If I can do something to help others who have it or who have loved ones who do but don't understand, to prevent any kind of pain for someone else, that's what helps make what I've dealt with have sense, in some fashion. 4.

      "I read this. I understand what you are going through. I always overthink so much I even tried to put myself in others shoe. I just start to distance myself from others, even my close friends. The only person who truly knows about my messed up personality is my partner. I have seen, read, and heard from others that friends and family can't tackle a severely depressed person because they have their own set of problems in life. So, they tend to not bring other negativity resulting them in either cutting us off. I told my partner about the warnings of mental stress they will have while dealing with me and my depression. But they are a tough nut to crack and all they showed me are support and their unbreakable determination to help me get better. That crushes me even more because I feel like that's not how it will end and then being close to me will eventually break them even more than me. So I tried to distance myself from my partner as well. However, people that truly care about you will come and find you, and they will not let go of your hand until you can be truly happy.  (tw) I have hated everything about me and have tried to k*ll myself multiple times but failed. Now I have side effects from those. My throat has been raspy, I can't eat food without discomfort, I get phlegm that are either dark or bloody. I cannot straighten my wrists or I get triggered. I have a messed up sleeping schedule and my life is nothing close to being normal. It's not worth it to do it so please try to find peace within yourself. Whether it means to sit down and talk them through so they understand, or cut off friends who let you down or meditating on your own to change your course of thoughts, or finding an easy distraction go keep you away from others and thinking a lot.\n",

I can relate to over thinking everything, and still struggle with that on a daily basis, but over time I've learned to manage it. Its important not to beat your self up over it, that will only add fuel to the flame. Being self aware that your thoughts are feeding you negativity, and seeing through them as if they were lies has helped me. Keep yourself distracted, explore different hobbies, take up a new activity.  It may feel like your in a hopeless battle with your mind, but it isn't hopeless. Thoughts are indeed just that, thoughts. Whether you choose to believe them or reflect them away, is up to you. Your only human, and people are here for you. I care, and believe in you ðŸ’ªâ™¥ï¸\n",

It might have helped with depression while you were drinking it, know you feel extra depressed until that stuff is out of your system afterwards.   Try to do one productive thing a day to help release a small amount of happy chemicals in your brain. The same with not staying in bed for 24 hours, try to get up once, even walking around or do a house project or conducting personal hygiene, a small amount of physical work that will help release \"happy\" chemicals in your body as well.  Keep striving for balance. Time will heal. You won't always feel this way. Things will change over time, even if you feel like that won't . Try to do one productive thing a day.

New walking trail, new to me ethnic food, new kind of fitness, new area of the city to walk in... the newness slows down time, and we create more memories as we are taking in an environment or hobby for the first time. Helps lessen the feeling stuck and hopelessness vibes.   Sharing and giving back, using my lil bit of power to make the world a better place. I do volunteer work.   Gratitude.

Its easy to make stupid mistakes when your unable to realize the damage your doing in the moment. Ive said stupid shit only to realize that what ive done is a huge mistake afterwards. You can't take back what you've said, but you can try to learn from it.   Thankfully my bud has been one of the most loyal people ill probably have in my lifetime. Hes understood and forgiven me time after time. I feel like im on a thin line from losing that if i fuck up again, but that all falls on me. Im learning to catch my self in the moment and stop myself. Its incredibly difficult, but it takes time.

That why i beilieve it's not a good thing to commit suicide because death is coming anyway so why not wait patiently! U may think something like \"if it's coming anyway why not just kill myself now and avoid a lifetime of suffering\" and well it's because life is a good thing! U were made to live and life is a good place and u will find happiness in life because it's made like that! U either die brutally because of an accident or something or u find happiness at one point!

I dropped out of school and plunged myself into debt just to stay in the same house we planned to start our family in. I wanted nothing more than to fulfill her dream of starting a family and a life with someone who would give nothing but unconditional love and support. Why do we have to feel this way? What in the universe decided to make the people who have nothing but a brick fucking house of a heart to feel such misery?   You deserve so much more than the man that abandoned you and your dreams. I know that because I can recognize that I deserve that too. We both deserve someone who will believe in us and love us unconditionally regardless of whatever flaws we have or problems we encounter. There is someone out there who will make you understand this. I know it feels like it will never happen, or that you could never love someone the same way you loved him, yet I also know that if I can recognize that I have this love deep inside me and compassion for others, there has to be at least one other person on this Earth who knows what its like to feel like the universe is collapsing on you.   I want you to know its not, there will be someone else who sparks the fire within you. Someone will come along and bring out the true you who you've always wanted to become.   Please don't give up. I know I dont know you personally but I know if my heart is so pure, that there are other people out there just like me suffering the same way. We deserve more. YOU deserve more.\n",

Dealt with the loss of a loved one due to suicide when a month before that I had an attempt. Dealt with numerous of my own attempts, struggling with depression on the daily. Going through all the highs and lows, most on my own, and other times with someone I have built a very close friend ship with who i owe my life to (love him like family)   I feel happy with my life at the moment, and even though im in a financial situation, mentally i don't feel like im struggling as much anymore, or at the very least as much as i used to. I feel the best that I have in a long time.   With that being said, im not afraid to die either. I feel like im destined to take my own life, and that's probably how ill go out of this world eventually. And im ok with that. And being ok with it brings me a sort of bliss. maybe its because I've been defeated so much that having that escape route incase things go bad again that make it oddly comforting?

But then of course there's a difference between feeling that way because it's expected from your age or if you have depression. As always the best thing is to talk to someone you trust and figure out your feelings and solutions for what bothers you. Either way, therapy is a great for both that and if you actually are depressed. Please look for help :)\n",

      "Don't worry.  Worst case - absolute worst case, absolute - is that you'd be required to take your GCSEs in a seat where you couldn't overlook anyone. Since you weren't copying anyone else, you're still just taking your own exam.  But that's not going to happen. I doubt the teacher gives a fuck tbh - mock exams are really just practice, and one pupil's word against another is nothing to build a case on, let alone discipline anyone. If they say 'we know what you did and we'll keep an eye on you' then that's all bluster.  Even people who plagiarize their whole University essays or research don't tend to suffer consequences beyond having to repeat a year - so while the GCSEs (and the mocks) seem like a big deal, they're not and not worth getting stressed out over - and certainly not worth doing anything severe over.  The school and the teachers want everyone to get good exam results - for their records as well as wanting you to do well. They don't want to  jeopardise  that.  If it helps I had a similar thing doing my GCSEs - I finished one exam paper early, so went back and did more on a previous paper - we did them one after the other - so in effect I spent 1.5 hours on one exam and 2.5 on one which should have been 2 hours each. I was wracked with concern and guilt and eventually tearfully confessed only to be told 'Don't worry about it' by the teacher.  So, yeah - don't worry man. This time next year you'll have forgotten all about it.  Hope that helps.\n",

      "During quarantine, we all have had very limited social interactions face to face with people so it is completely normal to have increased nerves about doing something you aren't used to anymore. Try out some of the tips I've listed below to help when you're feeling panicked.  Here are several ways to calm yourself down during and after a panic attack:  1. Focus on your breathing - Most panic attacks cause breathing to become erratic and difficult to control, even hyperventilating. One of the BEST things you can do during a panic attack is focus on your breathing. Take a deep breath in, hold for 5 seconds, then let it out slowly. Repeat this process until you can feel yourself calming down. 2. Ground yourself - In the moment, you may feel scared. Instead of focusing on this fear, focus on things around you. For example, your shoes, clothes, how the air smells, etc. 3. Relax your muscles - During a panic attack, your muscles may get very tense without you realizing it. Concentrate on relaxing your muscles starting from the top of your body and move down slowly, relaxing each muscle group separately. 4. Keep in mind that the attack will pass and that you will be ok! 5. Exercise can help blow off steam and anxiety that has built up as a result of the aftermath of a panic attack. This can help calm your body down after the fact but is also great to incorporate into your routine for overall benefits of decreased anxiety. A short walk each day or a few times a week could make a difference. No need for strenuous exercise to achieve anxiety relief! 6. Speak to a therapist. Therapists can walk you through a time of crisis or increased panic and give you tools and professional advice catered to you specifically  [Source of info](https://claritychi.com/7-tips-for-calming-a-panic-attack/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=7-tips-for-calming-a-panic-attack)\n",

Itâ€™s easy to have this mindset but I guarantee if you actually experienced life while being terminally ill, you would never have this mindset. It is kind of insensitive.   Nobody who has a terminal illness would ever consider it something to â€œfantasize aboutâ€ or â€œwish forâ€.    My uncle was terminal. He also was extremely depressed as a result of his terminal illness. It was a painful road to walk before his death. It is not something I would wish on anyone, and itâ€™s not something anyone should be wishing for.   Iâ€™m not trying to invalidate your feelings or guilt trip you. But this is a bad mindset to have. It is not something that will help you.   If I were you, I would put some serious research into understanding terminal illness. Maybe even speak to someone who is experiencing it. This will help you view terminal illness in a more realistic light.   Try to change your mindset from fantasizing about having a terminal illness to being grateful that you donâ€™t.

      "People talk about \"staying together for the kids\", but where abuse is involved, I would think it'd be more accurate to say \"splitting up for the kids\". It's not at all healthy for kids to witness abuse of any kind in the household.  If you have a son, he is learning abuse tactics from your partner. The home is often the initial training ground for abusers. This is where they learn about how relationships work. Lessons like: \"What am I entitled to in a relationship?\" or \"How should I treat my partner?\" are modeled by example for us by our parents. Boys with abusive fathers in the home learn that they are entitled to, well, just about everything, and that they should punish their partner for stepping out of line.  Girls internalize these messages too, in the converse way. They see that their mother is entitled to nothing but crumbs, and allows herself to be treated poorly by their father. This relationship forms the foundation for what they see as \"normal\" within relationships.  Beyond this, abuse causes untold amounts of damage to each family member and the dynamics between them. Being a kid whose parents are split up is hard, but so is being a kid whose home is a psychological warzone. Even if you have to end up splitting custody, your kids will spend ~50% of their time in a home that is safe, calm and nurturing. That's much better than 100% of the time playing Happy Families with a father who is abusive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, I don't think it has anything to do with his \"temper\". Abuse hardly ever does. Calling you these names is a strategy. The goal is to make you feel incompetent and dependent on him. It's meant to lower your self esteem and make you more likely to accept the abuse because you feel you deserve it because you've made a mistake and \"wronged\" him.  Let me ask you this. Has he ever called his boss or one of his coworkers a \"fucking retard\"? Has he ever called one of his professors an \"ungrateful bitch\"? Doubtful. If this is the case, ask yourself why he's suddenly able to control his temper in situations where flying off the handle would have negative repercussions for him? Why won't he bother to control his temper to avoid hurting someone he supposedly loves and cares about? It's because **this isn't about his temper, or his feelings at all. It's about control. It's about his attitudes and beliefs.**  In fact, I'd be willing to bet you are not especially scattered, at least not any more than most people are.  >I work full-time and have part time freelance clients because I'm saving up to pay for my visa without any help from anyone...I cook most days and tidy the house and do alot of the laundry.  The above paragraph portrays someone who more or less has their shit together. It's pretty much the opposite of the picture your boyfriend paints of you with his insults.  My ex did this exact same thing to me(including the frequent repetition of the specific phrase \"fucking retard\"). I'm aware of my shortcomings as a person. I can be forgetful or scattered from time to time, but not significantly more scattered than an average person. He noticed that this was something I felt self conscious/guilty about and exploited it. You think you're \"a mess\" and you get disappointed and feel like an idiot when you make a minor mistake(and, really, these mistakes are very minor).  Your boyfriend is doing the same thing my ex did--exploiting a weakness. Abusers are really good at putting your minor flaws under a microscope and blowing them way out of proportion to justify their abuse to you AND to themselves.\n",

I got the impression that she really didnâ€™t want to be a therapist. She seemed to reluctantly make the first appointment. At the end of my last session I told her I couldnâ€™t make another appointment because my work schedule was hectic. It took her three months to bill my insurance and she still hasnâ€™t sent me a bill for my copay. It was almost 9 months ago. A few months ago my insurance company told me she was no longer in plan.

I understand you are using a subsidized program, but nonetheless, you are still entitled to a certain standard of care.   Malpractice can be a thing in any field. Therapists included. Patient abandonment specifically is a very big deal. I think you should have an honest conversation with your therapist about how you feel, and how you think therapy needs to change in order to be more affective.   Just remember as a patient you do have rights so if you are not receiving the level of care you are entitled to, you can and should say something.   Long term goal I think should be to find a different therapist. A bad one can be a nightmare. A good one can be life changing.\n",

You will act happy as itâ€™s something ur supposed to feel but not actually feel any thing. Main thing I wud say would be the numbness that comes with. It crushes me. I will hear of very sad news or experience something very nice yet still be completely blanked out. Tbh I just wanna breakdown or just fucjing cry so bad. Itâ€™s been 2 years since I last expressed emotions or cried. And I have been working on it since but shit in life is going the other way. Currently Iâ€™m doing absolute shit in school and in life aswell, social life , health life.
